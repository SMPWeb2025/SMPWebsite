        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Ever wondered when flying in an airplane at 35,000 ft in the air, that just how did this marvel happen? How did we humans move from the land to the sky? If these questions provoke your mind, then Aerospace Engineering might have the answers you need. From the working of planes to rockets and from missiles to satellites to flying robots, Aerospace Engineering spans it all. Yes, it is quite literally, “Rocket Science”.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Aerospace Engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Aerospace Engineering comes out as a really exotic branch in an engineering world where computer science, mechanical and electrical engineering are all the fiasco. A relatively newer branch as compared to the conventional engineering branches, it is a very interesting and involved branch in itself. Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay deals with both air and space. There is a decent amount of Physics involved and through the course of four years, you get exposed to experiments and laboratory projects that keep you inspired with the real life applications of what you are to study. At the end of your degree, you will have a clear understanding of how aircraft and rocket systems work, from all structural, aerodynamic, controls and propulsion points of view. The department is very flexible on cross-department courses, since it draws a lot from other departments like systems and control electrical and computer science.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          While the first year is basically involved in consolidating basic knowledge in calculus, physics, chemistry and biology (like every other department). The second year lays down the basic foundation in all the four major areas which are Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics, Systems & Controls, Structures and Propulsion. The third year involved deeper understanding of all the four areas. This is when you’re exposed to a lot of experimental and laboratory work, which gives you an exciting perspective into how these things fit into the real world applications of Aerospace. The fourth year gives your entire experience a closure by having an Aircraft Design exercise where you apply all the knowledge that you’ve gained through the four years of learning in the department to create a technologically-viable aerospace product of your own. The department is very well-suited for pursuing research in any of these fronts. Most people opt for a Supervised Learning Program and B.Tech Projects to get their hands dirty with core research in aerospace.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Four major areas come under the umbrella of Aerospace Engineering:
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Since very beginning humanity has been fascinated by flight and we are no exception. Since childhood, you must have wondered what makes these plane fly? How can such heavy objects be lifted? Why birds fly in particular fashion or why racing cars are designed in way they are? You must have wondered about all the fuss about sonic barrier and what's so special about it. While studying aerodynamics, we try to understand forces on a medium in which we have lived our whole life. It's not just about those wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamics but also about all fluids - air, water, blood etc. and their interactions with boundaries. It begins with a course on fluid mechanics which includes an introduction to simple topics such as Bernoulli theorem and covers the foundation such as potential flow concept necessary to understand the flow over airfoils. It is followed by a course on Aerodynamics which uses some basics from fluid mechanics to analyze the flow past airfoils. It also teaches some experimental techniques which are currently used to simulate flow over aircrafts. Apart from these we also have many electives which you can take based on your interest like computational fluid dynamics, study of hypersonic flow, experimental method in fluid dynamics, etc. In addition to these theory courses there are laboratory courses to familiarize you about high speed experiments, flow over aerodynamic bodies and certain other experiments designed to test the theories which you have learnt in the courses.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Propulsion</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          The plane is sturdy, the plane can balance itself but how does it move at unbelievable speeds? What powers such heavy bodies to fly at speeds six times greater than the speed of sound? Engines - heart of every locomotive are very fascinating things. Squeezing out every possible bit of thrust from fuel without compromising with safety is what separates leaders from pretenders. Here we study about engines which power our flying crafts. It basically involves an in-depth study of each and every component of engines and also talks about various types of engines such as turbojet, turbofan, ramjet, scramjet engines etc., The courses in propulsion starts with a basic course in thermodynamics, starting briefly with the basic concepts and quickly turning over to the practical applications of the theory to the engines. Then there is a course following it describing specifically each and every component of engine such as inlet, compressor, combustor, turbine, nozzle, etc., This will give you an opportunity to analyze any aircraft engine, may be the one which you see in your flight from your home to Mumbai. As with the other areas, propulsion is also supported by some laboratory courses through which you gain hands-on experience to some of the components of engine and also to use a small scale aircraft engine as a whole.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Structures</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          You must have seen lot of fascinating airborne bodies and must have wondered why these don't fail. You may have heard about air crashes and also tall claims like dying in airplane has almost same probability as dying in bathtub. These make us wonder about stability and safety of aircraft, especially when you see wings flex during the flight. Structures not only take care of forces acting on such bodies or deformations caused by them but also of all interactions taking place between these bodies and the air around them. Structures form most integral part of safety limits of any airborne objects. The basic sequence of courses includes introduction with Solid Mechanics which creates a link between what you have learnt in high school and what you will be dealing with while designing or analyzing the structural components of an Aerospace vehicle. This gives a basic introduction to structures. It is followed by a course focusing on aerospace structures such as ribs, spar web, etc., in wings or theories such as thin-walled theory to analyze the Aerospace structures. Apart from these we also have many electives which you can take based on your interest like aero elasticity, vibrations in Aerospace structures, composite materials etc. The theory courses are supplemented with the laboratory courses which includes testing strengths of different materials using different techniques, synthesizing composites used in aviation industry, etc.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Controls</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          How does an autopilot work? How can military aircraft perform insane maneuvers during dog fights? Aircraft controls is responsible for this and involves all the instruments which are used to control aircraft, satellites, missiles, launch-vehicle or any other aerial vehicle. After having the structural body, aerodynamic and propulsion analysis ready, what is left is how to fly or navigate the aerospace vehicles from one place to another. It does analysis to transport an aircraft from one place to another, to launch a satellite in its orbit, to launch a missile and to make it continuously follow the target, to keep track of satellites and many more things. There are a number of theory and laboratory courses in this field which give you an idea of the basics of control theory and slightly moves on to more advanced topics leading to an understanding of many real-life missions. The courses aims at analyzing the trajectory of a launch vehicle, the maneuvers of an aircraft, and designing the control systems which are used to control them. Basically, task is to develop a brain for everything we can design.
        </p>


        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are an Aerospace Engineer?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          In a country where aerospace hasn't opened up as well for the private sector, the placement for Aerospace engineers from IIT Bombay isn’t all that bad. Graduates from IIT Bombay are placed all over the world, and the alumni network is immensely widespread, with preferred destinations ranging from companies like Boeing, Airbus, GE, Honeywell etc. to Indian space organizations / aircraft laboratories like ISRO, NAL, HAL and DRDO. For a subject as research oriented as aerospace engineering, higher studies is also a popular option where our seniors have secured post graduation in top notch universities.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Department Alumni</h1>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Ankit Shah, Aerospace Engg, B.Tech (2013)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          <b>Motivations behind choosing Aero, expectations and reality?</b> <br/>
          I always wanted to work with aircrafts and spacecrafts since I was a kid and Aerospace was my first choice in terms of branches. I had read up on basics of principles of flight well before JEE admissions and even JEE preparation. I was aware of what the course of study would include. The reality was quite aligned with what I had thought. The B.Tech course gave a very broad overview of all the sectors involved in Aerospace, including structures, propulsion, aerodynamics, controls and design. The electives in the curriculum allowed me to study a particular area in greater detail.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Activities you were involved in?</b> <br/>
          I was involved with the Student Satellite Project, Advitiy for almost 4 years at IIT-B. I worked with the integration and later the control systems team. I was also involved in aeromodelling, first as an enthusiast and later in a managerial role for a year. The student involvement in aeromodelling in the last 2 years of my stay at IITB was great. I had also made a conscious effort towards my academics and I found most of the courses to be very enjoyable.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>What according to you are some of the exciting new areas in this field?</b><br/>
          I think networked constellation of small satellites, autonomous aircrafts, intelligent systems, more environmentally aware civilian airspace will become key areas in the future. Space exploration initiatives are also taking off in India in terms of more advanced science missions and more capable launch systems.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>

          <b>What can freshmen expect from the department and IITB, job and higher studies prospects? </b><br/>
          Placements have a lot to do with individual motivation and initiative. However I can say that the curriculum was well balanced and provided a good overview of the aerospace sector. In addition the institute core curriculum also does a good job of arming one with the tools required work in non-aerospace sectors like finance, consulting or management. Higher studies is also an option I would strongly recommend. The institute, department and the faculty are well known around the world. Many alumni of the department are working towards or have completed post graduate degrees in many universities worldwide.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>What are you currently involved in?</b><br/>
          I am currently at MIT and working towards my PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics. My area of research is in autonomous systems. I am interested in developing ways for an intelligent agent to perform combined task and motion level planning. The scientific and mathematical tools I use involve control theory and some basics of planning algorithms.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>How did IITB and the Aerospace Department help shape your life?</b><br/>
          I had a very enjoyable four years at the Aerospace department. I enjoyed the courses and the learning. I found the faculty to be very approachable and friendly. But above all, the thing I value the most was my time with the Satellite project. I learnt a lot about engineering by actually working towards building a system and working with others in a team. I found great friends amongst the student mentors of the team. I also improved a lot technically in preparing and facing the tough questions during project reviews by our faculty mentors. I feel I must espcially thank Prof Sudhakar for always being there to guide me in my journey through IIT-B right from the Introductory Course, through Advitiy and my final year project.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Aviation is the pinnacle of all the engineering disciplines. It is that field where the cream of all engineering comes together to help man realize his wildest dream, that of flying. Like most kids, I was always fascinated by flying. However, what interested me the most was not just the flying itself, but what actually goes into building something that can fly. The undergrad aerospace curriculum set me on my first steps to understanding just that. And the journey didn’t end there. I got inspired by what I had learnt during my undergrad to pursue post-graduate studies in Aerospace. Currently, I am a doctoral candidate in the Aerospace Engineering department at Georgia Institute of Technology.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The professors at IITB AE are renowned experts in their respective fields and are all involved, directly or indirectly, in shaping the future of aviation in our nation. They serve as experts on issues of national defense and commercial aviation, act as consultants to leading aerospace firms and lead research efforts to expand the frontiers of science in general and aviation in particular. Though a bit intimidating at first, once you get to know them better, you find a treasure trove of knowledge, experience and insight within each and every professor.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Toward this end of getting to know a professor beyond what is taught in class, the AE school offers a Supervised Learning Program (SLP) wherein a student works under the guidance of a professor for a semester of research. I did two SLPs during my undergrad and I learnt loads from them; not only about technical issues but issues relating to how research is carried out in teams, how knowledge sharing is done, how to communicate and present and defend your work and how a large scale problem which is beyond any you have seen in class can be tackled by breaking it into bits and tapping into the expertise and dedication of the team members. I am still using those lessons I learnt today in my research effort here at Georgia Tech.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Finally, at IITB, you would be surrounded by gems of people. People so sharp, so motivated and so clear in their thought process that you would always have someone to look up to, someone to be strive to be better than, someone to be inspired by and someone to learn something from. That is the most important thing about IITB in that it teaches you to always set the bar high. It gives you the confidence to take on any problem, any challenge knowing that giving it your best shot would most likely result in something exciting. At IITB AE specifically, I can confidently assert that I learnt as much from my peers as I did from my professors.
        </p>
        Aviation in India is poised for big things and you are going to be the leaders to take our nation onto the frontiers of aviation and beyond.

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Chemical engineers deal with the transformation of raw materials into useful products that have an impact on virtually every facet of human life. Many of these products are commodities obtained from oil and natural gas, such as soaps, detergents, cosmetics, liquid and gaseous fuels, synthetic fibers and plastics. Chemical engineers work out the processes to make all these products, while also helping to manage the world's resources, protect the environment and ensure health and safety standards are met.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Difference between a Chemist and a Chemical Engineer</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Chemical Engineering is NOT equal to chemistry. Yes, we do study chemistry, and yes, the engineering is applied so that the chemistry that chemists (not engineers) come up with can be transformed into large scale manufacturing.
          <br/>
          As Prof. M.S. Ananth rightly said: A chemical engineer is someone who knows enough physics/mechanics to confuse a chemist, enough chemistry to confuse a physicist/mechanical engineer, and enough mathematics to confuse himself.
        </p>
      <br/>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Chemical Engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Chemical Engineering involves the scaling up the reactions performed in a chemistry laboratory to produce the desired chemical on an industrial scale. However, this requires an understanding of principles of micro, meso and macro scale processes which are dealt with while doing the courses.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Within Chemical Engineering, there are two broad subgroups. One of them deals with the design, manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery in industrial chemical and related processes ("chemical process engineers") while the other deals with the development of new or adapted substances for products ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics to cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many other products ("chemical product engineers").
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">B.Tech Program</h2> 
          The curriculum in B.Tech Chemical Engineering is designed to give you an exposure to a wide variety of fields. Core courses in Transport Phenomena, Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Chemical Reaction Engineering, and Control Theory help give a BTech student an overview of all areas in Chemical Engineering department. Further, by pursuing an Honors degree or undertaking the final year project, B.Tech students have the opportunity to specialize, to some extent, in the area of their interest. In addition to theory courses, laboratory courses also make sure that the student gets a hands-on experience, and they supplement the theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom. The undergraduate students can also undertake various research projects either through Undergraduate Research Award (URA) or through the B.Tech project (BTP).
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Honors in Chemical Engineering</h2>

          A B.Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honors in Chemical Engineering” when s/he has taken 24 extra credits (4 additional courses, comprising of 2 compulsory courses, and 2 electives) in the department, over and above the normal credit requirement. This is meant for students who wish to explore more about the Chemical Engineering field.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Dual Degree (DD) Program</h2>

          B.Tech students with a CPI greater than 7 are given an option to convert to a Dual Degree (DD) Program. Students interested in the DD program should register for and complete the additional Honors courses, and apply for the conversion at the end of the seventh semester. A DD Programme gives you a B.Tech + M.Tech degree in 5 years. DD students have to do one extra course every semester (which is easily manageable) and a yearlong project in their 5th year.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">B. Tech Project (BTP)</h2>

          Previously a mandatory component of the B. Tech curriculum, the B. Tech project (BTP) is now optional. The BTP is a yearlong project that allows you to have a taste of research at the undergraduate level. You can choose any sub-field in Chemical Engineering that interests you the most and work on a new, unsolved research problem under the guidance of a professor.


          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Undergraduate Research Award (URA01)</h2>

          This is recognition of a small research/developmental effort, successfully completed by a student in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate program. A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project. The student works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for a duration of 4-6 months. If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any stage, s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Chemical engineering has courses that cover almost all genres of engineering. It is basically industrial engineering. So, you study everything that you would be required to apply in an industry. Traditionally, the study of Chemical Engineering majorly relies on the 5 pillars of Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Chemical Reaction Engineering and Process Control. In your second third and third years, you would basically encounter a few courses from each subfield. The fourth year involves incorporating all of these disciplines and designing chemical processes. The rest of the coursework involves electives. Through these electives, you can choose to study advanced topics in any of the subfields mentioned.
        </p>


        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Let us walk through the core specializations through a story.
          <br/>
          <br/>    
          X is a chemical engineer. A chemical engineer par excellence. One fine day, he is summoned by his boss and given a new assignment. The chemists of the company have found that if reactants A and B are mixed, then the valuable product P will be formed. X's boss tells him to engineer this reaction into being. And so X sets to work.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Thermodynamics and Kinetics</h2>

          Being a healthy skeptic, X is not entirely convinced about the chemists' calculations. So he first studies the thermodynamics of the process to understand the conditions at which it would be feasible to carry out the reaction. Temperature, pressure, composition, solvent nature ... all are variables which X can adapt and fine-tune to the process at hand. He also understands the factors that affect the reaction rate to use them favorably. Apart from the reaction being feasible and fast, he also has to worry about side reactions, stability of all concerned species and phase homogeneity. These are complex calculations and so he uses computational techniques and software to help him in making decisions. He also requests the chemists to double-check his results in some lab experiments.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Reactor Design</h2>

          Once X is satisfied that the reaction can be implemented, he turns to the heart of the process, the reactor. He has briefly looked at possible catalysts when studying the kinetics, but this time he goes deeper. He plays around with some molecular simulation tools to find what catalyst could give the best results in terms of conversion, yield and selectivity. He also factors in the catalyst stability into his calculations. Once he's done on this front, he wonders what reactor design to use. A fixed bed? A fluidized bed? A stirred tank? A membrane reactor? Is it advantageous to use multiple reactors? How large should these reactors be? Of what material should they be made? He pays special attention to the physical phases and chemical natures of the participating species while making this decision.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Equipment Design</h2>

          X realizes early on that just the reactor isn't sufficient. Unfortunately, A and B are not obtained in very pure form and so he must do some 'pre processing'. He considers a variety of techniques such as washing with a solvent, selective chemical reactions, filtration, crystallization, distillation, and chooses the one that is the most suitable. These processes need special equipment and he designs them accordingly. There's also some 'post processing' he has to accomplish, for P is not the sole product obtained. So depending on the exact requirements, he installs equipment like absorbers, adsorbers or liquefiers. To simplify his task, he uses a computer which returns him the design once he specifies the layout.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Piping and Instrumentation</h2>

          To avoid high levels of unconsumed reactants, X considers the possibility of having a recycle stream for multiple runs. A purge stream might also be needed to avoid accumulation of inert substances and impurities. He also explores methods to transport the reaction mixture from one equipment unit to another. This could be achieved by gravity or using pumps or perhaps even conveyor belts. He designs these as well and optimizes the connecting pipes on the basis of pressure drop and space considerations. He also sets up measuring devices to monitor important parameters like the temperature, pressure, flow rate and composition during operation, most of which he has designed himself too. These are all compiled into a piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID), and X is always immensely proud of these!

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Control and Automation</h2>

          It's important to ensure that the system conditions stay within certain limits for stable operation. This is why X implements a large number of sensors and actuators which enable him to control the process. He has a large number of options here as well, with different types and mechanisms of controllers (PID, Adaptive, Fuzzy logic etc.) as well as a variety of valves with different configurations. Also, X decides how much of this control should be automated and how much of it should be manually operated. During this process, he keeps in mind his motto, "Safety first", for it's better to be safe than sorry every time.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Environmental Concernsn</h2>

          X is an environmentally-sensitive engineer. And so he makes sure that no potentially harmful substances are released into the environment. This requires special units or isolation measures - he could employ methods like chemical treatment, electrostatic precipitation, combustion-dispersal or controlled dumping. If possible, he also tries to find a use within his own industry for any toxic products that are produced.      

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">New Materials</h2>

          Another of X's colleagues has enlightened him about new materials. He has to come to learn of new membranes that can filter better and improved materials that increase adsorption efficiency. Polymers have found their way into his dictionary and he is learning to take advantage of their different properties. Bio-inspired materials are also growing in prominence by adapting the systems already in existence in nature and X keenly reads the latest research on these.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Nanotechnology</h2>

          X has also been alerted to the advantages of using very fine particles for industrial applications. Nanoemulsions and nanoparticle catalysts are hot areas in the modern day. These particles also have the ability to act as supports or carriers for other chemicals as well as dispersing agents. He carries out many simulations on these systems using diverse types of nanosystems.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Microfluidics</h2>

          Having taken a cue from some of his chemist friends, X is now thinking of microfluidic reactors. Using small tubes in a controlled fashion can be advantageous in many ways, especially for testing purposes. The dynamics in such systems might also be very different from that at the larger scales, so he is actively studying the phenomenon observed in microchannels and chips.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Packaging and Delivery</h2>

          Now the product P is obtained, but it needs to be converted to the appropriate form and delivered. Perhaps it needs to be made into tablets, perhaps it needs to be packaged as a powder, perhaps it needs to be compressed as a gas. X calls the shots and ensures proper formulation, handling and delivery. He also expresses his sentiments about the product appeal and target group to the designers and promoters.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Moral of the Story: </b>Chemical engineering is a diverse field which transcends boundaries by incorporating elements from many disciplines. A chemical engineer could be devising or characterizing catalysts, designing new and more efficient plant equipment, improving control strategies, formulating new fuels and energy sources, ameliorating packaging and transport, and much more.

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are a Chemical Engineer?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
        There is a lot research going on in the fields mentioned above. The curriculum allows students to explore the areas through electives and projects. Quite a lot of students who are interested in research go for MS/PhD in their area of interest at prestigious universities.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        The core sector involves FMCGs, PSUs, refineries, etc. Therefore, those who wish to get some industry exposure choose to take jobs in core sector which are available through placements. You could also make the switch to the non-core sector which involves finance, management, consultancy, etc.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Paridhi Agrawal, B.Tech, 2016</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I am a recent graduate from the Chemical Engineering Department at IITB and am looking forward to join the PhD program in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities this Fall. To be honest, my decision of joining an undergraduate program in Chemical Engineering was not so well-informed. All I knew at the time of my JEE counseling was that this department is very diverse, unlike a few others which help you specialize in a particular field. Physics, Math and Physical Chemistry excited me, and seeing that Chemical Engineering offered a study of these subjects and not traditional Chemistry, I had a vague feeling at that time that I would enjoy studying these subjects. As a freshman, I knew only so much about any branch, and I believe it is fair, given our scope of knowledge at the time of JEE counseling.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          To my surprise, the four year study turned out to be exactly as I was told in the beginning – analytical, involving a lot of concepts which can be used in very diverse fields and new and exciting at every stage. The kind of subjects we are taught here, although it wouldn’t make much sense to you right now, include Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Heat and Mass Transfer, Numerical Analysis, Process Systems Engineering etc. The initial years of Chemical Engineering curriculum are designed to lay a strong foundation of fundamental concepts, and the latter half concentrates on training us as a traditional Chemical Engineer, the lot who designs Chemical Process Plants and sets up factories and industries.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now there are many people who don’t like to enter into traditional ChemE, such as me. For folks like us, the Department offers a wide range of electives which are more inclined towards study of new and innovative Chemical Engineering topics, the ones that usually lead us to research. The Department is diverse for this particular reason – it offers you a set career in traditional ChemE, as well as an opportunity to indulge in upcoming fields such as Biochemical Engineering. You can be a scientist, a technician or an engineer! The various sectors where one can find a career after Chemical Engineering study include FMCG, Petrochemicals, Energy, Electronics, Biopharmaceutical etc.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As far as the Department at IITB is concerned, we have an active student body under ChEA (Chemical Engineering Association), the Department Symposium – AZeotropy and the student-run Biodiesel Plant – BioSynth. The best asset that our Department has is the Professors! We have an excellent set of faculty who are driven by quality research and teach very well. There are many learning opportunities for students who like to explore various fields in the form of projects offered by faculty. I have been actively involved in two projects during my Undergrad, and I believe that has played a major role in motivating me towards pursuing a career in research. Students also do major internships at the end of their third year, in companies like HUL, PnG, ITC, some in the non-core sector and a few in universities abroad.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the end, I believe you need to put your heart in what you choose to study. If you find a slight inclination towards any branch at the time of counseling, talk to a few seniors and find out more details about that field. If you are motivated to study what you have chosen as your branch, the odds of enjoying the course of your study are going to be in your favour. Good luck to all of you!

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Chemistry all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Department of Chemistry DOESN’T offer an engineering degree but the department offers bachelor degree (BS) or BS+M.Sc degree in pure science.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The BS/BS+M.Sc. program is structured such that a student can opt to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree, or opt to pursue with an extra year, a more thorough and research intensive Master’s degree. The option is open up to the fourth year. An interested student can also get an honours degree by completing 24 credits (4 courses) from a list of honours electives offered by the department. This gives you an opportunity to specialize in a sub domain of chemistry. The students can also opt to complete 6 - 12 of these 24 credits in the form of a Supervised Learning Project (SLP) which can be in form of a literature survey or a research project in your third year.

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Chemistry is the study of the phenomena of matter at various levels, and can be classified as the following:
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Organic Chemistry</h2>
          Organic Chemistry begins with a base that you are familiar with, of General Organic Chemistry and organic reactions, and moves on to its deeper aspects and applications. Synthesis is a large component of organic chemistry, which is applied in drug design, manufacture of natural products, catalysis. Other applications include semiconducting organic polymers and organic solar cells. Through coursework and labwork, we learn the reactions that constitute synthesis and principles such as controlling regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, and chemoselectivity. We also learn extensively the analysis of organic compounds using spectroscopic and chemical method.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Theoretical Chemistry</h2>
          This field attempts to understand chemical phenomena by reducing them to their fundamental molecular levels and studying them in terms of physical forces. One of the primary goals of the field is to constantly develop new understanding to model the behavior of molecular systems successfully and accurately. The fields most extensively involved in this work are Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics. The applications range from biophysics, biochemistry and medicine, to material science, and spectroscopy. This field is an overlap of Chemistry with Physics and Mathematics.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy</h2>
          Analytical chemistry involves the separation, identification and quantification of artificially synthesized compounds or chemicals isolated from natural sources. Analytical chemistry is mostly explored in the form of labwork. Spectroscopy is used to obtain a picture of the molecular world. MRI scans are based on the same concept as NMR Spectroscopy. The course content introduces you to the inherent quantum mechanical nature of spectroscopy, different types of spectroscopy.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Inorganic Chemistry</h2>
          Inorganic chemistry encompasses the structure and reactivity of a wide range of compounds made of elements ranging from metals to non-metals, solids to gases and ionic salts to covalent polymers. Core courses focus on periodicity and its consequences, properties of transition metals including magnetism, complex formation and reactivity. Inorganic chemistry finds applications in molecular magnets, hydrogen gas storage materials, catalysts, fuel, agriculture etc.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Computational Chemistry</h2>
          Computers have made access to hypothetical or experimentally inaccessible molecules and chemical systems possible. It is the study of matter at the microscopic level (even individual molecules) or involving short time frames (as much as just a femtosecond!) with the help of simulations that use a basic understanding of physical forces. It varies from a study of bond-breaking to the macroscopic study of proteins. This study uses programs that simulate the interactions between atoms and molecules using a theoretical and statistical understanding of chemistry. This gives the field a two-sided approach, understanding and evolving the methods of computational chemistry, as well as analyzing the results that are obtained. This method often goes hand in hand with Theoretical Chemistry.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Physical Chemistry</h2>
          Physical Chemistry studies the physical properties of matter, chemicals, and molecules at macroscopic and molecular levels. The macroscopic properties include the thermodynamic and electrochemical, while at the molecular level, the quantum mechanical properties of chemical bonds are studied in their experimental manifestation- spectroscopy. The thermodynamic properties of biomolecules are of great interest and are studied extensively at our department. Electrochemistry delves into cutting edge problems, for example that of solar cells.

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Civil Engineering is the field that reaches out far more than what you imagine it to be. A Civil Engineer is responsible for the design, construction and management of buildings, bridges, highways, airports, tunnels, water supply networks, wastewater treatment, transportation in a region and many more things which play an important role in the development of a place and add on to what a place really looks like. Nowadays, Civil Engineering has also found its importance in various fields that were never thought to have its application, like Structural analysis of human body, organs and cells, transportation of RBCs/WBCs in blood vessels etc
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Civil engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Often regarded as one of the earliest engineering branches, Civil Engineering is the discipline that deals with all structures that aid human life. Right from basic necessities like buildings for shelter to architectural wonders like the Taj Mahal or Pantheon. In addition, town planning, transportation planning, water supply and wastewater management, building dams and bridges and analyzing them also fall into the wide purview of Civil Engineering.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">B.Tech Program</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          The Civil Engineering department at IIT Bombay is ranked among the top universities around the world. The curriculum is designed to give you an exposure to a wide spectrum of related fields. Core courses in Structural Mechanics, Solid Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Geotechnical Engineering, Building Materials and Construction, Transportation Engineering and Remote Sensing help give a BTech student an overview of all areas in CE department. Further, by pursuing an Honors degree or undertaking the final year project, B.Tech students have the opportunity to specialize, to some extent, in the area of their interest. Laboratory courses make sure that the student gets hands on experience, and together with field visits (visits are not a part of the curriculum per se, yet are conducted often) they supplement the theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom. The objective is to create future leaders of industries, policy planners and administrators of infrastructure systems.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Honors in Civil Engineering</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          A worthwhile undertaking which also awards an additional degree in the transcript, it is meant for those who wish to explore more in Civil Engineering. A student can take 24 extra credits (4 additional courses) in the department, which must include two B.Tech projects (BTP 1 and BTP 2), to dive into deeper depths of Civil as a branch of life. The courses being offered as honors reflect advances in all the branches of civil engineering and are provided in good number for flexibility in choosing the ones matching a students interests.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Dual Degree in Civil Engineering</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          A student can convert from a 4 year B.Tech program to a 5 year dual degree, at the end of their 3rd year. After the additional year of academics, s/he will be awarded 2 degrees, BTech and MTech, instead of just one (BTech). The department has decided to offer dual degree programs in all the M.Tech. specialisations, viz., Transportation Systems Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Structural Engineering, Ocean Engineering and Remote Sensing
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Civil engineering courses deals with its sub departments, namely Transportation, Hydrology, Structural Mechanics, Geodesy, Soil Mechanics and Urban Sciences. We also have to study related mathematical courses necessary in this field. Most courses have the correct blend of theoretical knowledge and math which can keep a student interested and the variety of subtopics appeal to a multitude of students. The courses are complemented through equally informative labs , which enhance the practical knowledge of the field. The most exciting thing of this field is that you can always see for yourself and confirm to the things taught you inside the classroom the moment you step outside it, unfolding in front of you in the form roads, buildings, dams, bridges etc.
        </p>
      
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Subdisciplines</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Broadly, the programme can be divided into the following subdisciplines:
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Structural Engineering</h2>
          This field is for those who see the big structures around them and wonder how one could possibly build them. The programme has been designed to give you in-depth knowledge about everything that goes into construction of these structures.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The initial courses focus on building up the basics so that you can tell at the microscopic level how various forces in solids work. Later courses will help you analyse the effects these forces might have on the behavior of a structure as a whole.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This knowledge will impart enough understanding in order for the students to apply it towards design. Analogous to human beings, a structure cannot stand without a proper skeleton and the design courses are meant for learning how to design that skeleton.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Under this branch is also included the research to predict how good are different materials in construction. One deals with interesting stress-strain & behavioral analysis in materials like bamboo, steel, concrete, timber, rubber pads etc. Field visits offer a great deal of practical knowledge. Brilliant researches and development requirements in India make it the most demanding field of civil engineering.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Fluid Mechanics</h2>
          This field deals with behavior of fluids all around us. The course structure is designed to cover: 1. Fundamentals of fluid mechanics - classification and important properties of fluids 2. Fluid statics and dynamics 3. Flow through closed pipes & open-channels 4. Basics of lift and drag forces on objects moving in a fluid which serves important criteria for the design of aircrafts
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The slightly advanced course deals with open channel flows, momentum and energy of fluids.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Fluid Mechanics also forms a back-pillar of two other major fields including Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering, and thus covers widespread practical information.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The courses under Fluid Mechanics strengthen the concepts of forces, pressures, energy, momentum etc. as well as understanding of mathematical concepts of integration and differentiation and 3D coordinate geometry and hence serve a challenging ground for enthusiasts.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          What one learns during the course finds numerous applications all around including designing pipe networks for townships, designing canals to help in irrigation, or even designing fuel tanks, exhausts and combustion chambers for automobiles.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Hydrology</h2>
          Hydrology as a branch is quite different from fluid mechanics. It considers water as a very important natural resource and deals with its effective use and management.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The course structure deals with: 1. Tools and methods for predicting rainfall, peak flows and how different fundamental measures are taken to save water as a resource. 2. Planning, Construction and Operation of various types of water retention structures such as dams, barrages and weirs.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Hydrology involves mathematical concepts of probability and regression analysis which help us conclude about patterns and make predictions.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          One also learns about the management of water resources by studying canal routing, reservoir planning etc. Climate modeling, ground water conservation and other water-harvesting procedures find their ground in this field.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Remote Sensing</h2>
          Remote sensing at the very root means sensing the properties of an object from a distance (remotely). This simple process helps us obtain information which can be put to myriad uses. The field has evolved to great extent in the past few decades and includes such areas as:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Geographical Information System (GIS) or geographical surveying - Students get to learn the art of projecting an area of land into digital models and analyzing them to explore the various possibilities of use the land could be put to.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Global Positioning System (GPS) – Students learn the applications of GPS in various fields (other than the location services on mobile phones) including how it is one of the most valuable input sources for GIS.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Astronomy - Position of earth and locating places on earth using astronomical tools forms the centralized theme for it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Satellite imaging - This area deals with the use of satellites to photograph the earth and later image processing in order to obtain valuable information about atmospheric conditions, land cover (vegetation, topography), etc. This is also the same thing which makes popular Maps services (like Google Maps) come into existence. Students get to learn and explore how satellites in space really help us track down millions of problems.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Geotechnical Engineering</h2>
          Geotechnical engineering is the study of soil and its properties. The foundation of any structure rests on soil and so it is very important to know the properties of soil. Since soil is a natural material and we cannot change its composition, we study classification of soil to categorize them into different groups. The area also discusses various tests done on soil and design of some underground structures. We also learn about various techniques to improve soil properties.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The learning in this is divided in two compulsory courses in different semesters and later, there are a few advanced level optional courses as well, if a student wishes to further his knowledge in this field.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          IIT-Bombay proudly owns the India’s largest geo-centrifuge facility in its geotechnical laboratory.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Transportation Engineering</h2>
          This group of courses deals with exploring about not just vehicles on road but also all the management and planning that goes at back.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          With traffic issues becoming more severe day by day and with the advance of bigger lingering problems of congestion, fuel consumption, long rush etc., the need of the hour is to indulge in good technology and knowledge to get appropriate practice and adequate measures in implementation & this is what this branch prepares you for.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          One learns about how roads/rails/airports are designed, what goes into planning the flow of vehicles, how concerns of transportation problems are analyzed and dealt with using brilliant software and technologies.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Learning simulations of how things are realized in real-life forms an integral part of the learning.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The course involves topics from different fields including mathematics, statistics, computer science, designing etc. and thus tends to expand the scope of learning and application in wider areas of life.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Construction Technology and Management</h2>
          The curriculum exposes the students majorly to the behavior and properties of concrete and the elements that go into forming it. Concrete in recent times is one of the most widely used construction element due to the ease in which its properties can be altered for various applications. This field will explain how minor changes in materials used and their proportions can have a large change in the final properties of concrete. Based on the courses and linked laboratory courses one can have a deep understanding of the topic and observe its effects in all constructions around us. This field is particularly emerging and interesting as different types of concrete are being made all over the world everyday based on the applications. In the management aspect one deals with planning, design, and construction of a project from its beginning to its end.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Ocean Engineering</h2>
          The curriculum exposes the students particularly to the study of coastal and ocean infrastructure including port, dock and harbor structures, coastal protection works and offshore oil platforms, navigation. Included in the course works are the latest concerns on ocean environment, changing coastal laws and sea policies. After completing the necessary course, the students, rather now engineers, will be able to efficiently handle planning, analysis and design of engineering infrastructure at the coast as well as in the open ocean and also look after their construction, management and operation.

          <b>Future scope</b> Civil engineering, like most engineering fields, can be explored more through a number of ways. With the growing population there is a constant need to not only build new structures or replace old ones but also optimize to ensure there is no strain on resources. Town planning and Transportation planning and infrastructure are topics with a lot of scope along with constant innovation and development going on in structures and building materials. People who are interested in taking up field jobs end up in reputed construction companies . Higher studies is also a popular option where our seniors have secured post graduation in top notch universities.
          <br/>

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          At that time I believed that college was more important than branch. Civil engineering seemed like the best branch I could get at IIT Bombay. On entering IIT Bombay, I expected the professors to be good and courses to be interesting. Both were true. About the courses though, now I believe all courses, irrespective of branch, are interesting if you want to learn. From IITB they can expect the company of people smarter than themselves, and a strong culture of promoting self-learning and independent thinking. From the department, students can expect supportive and knowledgable professors who will guide them well, but only if the students are open to guidance. Students who are interested in learning (anything, not just courses) are almost certainly going to have a bright future. There are very few places which offer so many career options as IIT does. Core jobs in civil are on the rise with the industry picking up. The scene is surely getting better. Non-core jobs are picked by the majority, there are many exciting fields to work in which are very rewarding financially as well. These days startups are doing a great job of letting young people explore interesting fields in great detail, and IITB is fast becoming the hub of Indian startup activity. If a student develops a deep passion for a subject, higher studies can of course be pursued. I am currently running a civil design consultancy with my friends from IITB. We have also recently started a technology firm for public transportation. Before starting my own venture, I worked with Gammon India Ltd. for 3 years as a bridge designer. IITB has had a deep impact in shaping me into what I am today. Being surrounded by people as smart or smarter than me raised the bar for me. It brought me out of my comfort zone and made me realise how much I didn’t know. This ultimately led to me learning a lot more things a lot faster. The exposure I got from seeing my seniors, peers and even juniors doing great things also made me aware of the possibilities which existed for me. The freedom I got at IIT, coupled with a culture which fosters self-belief, gave me a chance to explore the world in my own way. It made me believe I can achieve anything I want to, and taught me to equip myself to do exactly that. The IIT brand also opens up a lot of doors, irrespective of what you are doing. It makes it easier to approach people and make them believe in you.

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Looking back to my JEE times I realise it was not easy to choose a department. But one thing that definitely helped me was that I was always amazed by the megastructures, their importance, their scale of complexity. And thus I wanted to know the science behind them. So Civil Enginnering seemed to be the most natural choice for me at that time. Like any other enthusiastic teenager I was ready to conquer the world and had high expectations from the department. But slowly I realised that in reality, it takes time to reach the point where you can go into the complexities which you have dreamed of. One should understand that what he/she sees in documentaries or any other shows related to structures, actual engineering and science is totally different (and much more interesting) from it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          IIT Bombay is a great platform where where your dreams can take wings. IITB is a place which will teach you how to fly, but its in your own hand to equip your flight with the extraordinary gadgets which will help you in flying higher and higher. A very common misconception in that "life is chill after IIT". But in reality continual progress is most important aspect in field of your interest. One cannot rely on a single achievement, you have to move on to conquer the next challenge. I am currently I am an Offshore Structural Designer in UAE. Looking back what I can say for sure is that IITB taught me to be achievement oriented. It doesn't matter in what field you choose (core/ non core), what matters is your passion towards your work and quality of your deliverables. And if you are able to keep pushing yourself during your stay here you can succeed anywhere in the world.

          “Computer science is not really about computers -- and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petridishes...and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use.”

          Computer Science is the study of theoretical foundations of information and computation and of practical techniques for their implementation and application. And then, there’s Computer Engineering -the application of Computer Science to actually design, create and build new, exciting stuff.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is CSE Engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          For things that are indispensable to most of us, computers and the Internet are surprisingly recent. It is often hard to imagine and digest the fact that there was no Internet till the '90s. The field of Computer Science was previously thought to be a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering and much of the faculty members at CSE are in fact Electrical Engineers. However, Today Computer Science is considered a fundamental Science and is a discipline on its own. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay was established very recently in 1982 and is one of the newest departments in IITB. Today, the department of CSE at IIT Bombay is one of the largest CSE departments in the country. From 2008, the department only offers the B. Tech Programme at the time of admission in the undergraduate level. However, students have the option of converting to a Dual Degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) programme subject to reasonable academic performance.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A study in Computer Science is not all about coding or learning multiple programming languages as it is popularly thought. In fact, it is not even all about computers. The most crucial chunk of what you will take away from a B. Tech in CSE, IITB is much different. The B. Tech. curriculum is designed to introduce an undergraduate student to the entire breadth of the field of Computer Science and Engineering with a huge diversity in the courses. While the mandatory core curriculum rarely goes into the depths of any particular field, the department offers numerous electives that the students can take up based on the sub-disciplines that interest them. The B. Tech. programme at IIT Bombay is one of the most flexible among all IITs, with a very lean mandatory component - called the core curriculum, leaving you plenty of time to explore the various fields that interest you - CSE or otherwise. True to its name, a B. Tech. study in CSE, IITB has two major components. - Science and Engineering. But, before that you will be acquainted with the crucial tool that will enable the study of Computer Science and all of Engineering - Programming. This will majorly be in your first year where students of all departments will take up an introductory course in programming. In addition, CSE first years will also have an advanced programming course, where they will be introduced to a number of programming paradigms. “Science” will occupy the major chunk of your courses in your second year. You will be introduced to courses in Data Structures, Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Machines, Logic, Computability, etc. Once you’ve learnt enough science, you will learn how to apply them and create and design stuff a.k.a. engineering. This is what you would be doing in your third year with courses like Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Networks, Databases. Artificial Intelligence, etc. The curriculum ensures that there is a mix of science and engineering in all the semesters so that you don’t get bored. The final year is left free to explore those fields that most interest you. This is in the form of electives - in the department and otherwise and also through an optional B. Tech. Project (BTP). Below are a few sub-disciplines of Computer Science and Engineering that you will be introduced to as part of the curriculum with an amalgamation of both the science and engineering components to it.

        </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Honors in Computer Science</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          A B. Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honours in Computer Science and Engineering” when she/he has done a certain number of courses from the honours course list of the department over and above the normal credit requirement (24 credits are required from the 2014 batch). These courses are typically done in the second, third and fourth years. The exact details of the programme are clearly specified in the academic rulebook of the Institute. The department has a fairly flexible honor programme allowing the choice of a great number of courses for the honors requirements. Many undergraduate courses are offered as honors courses and every postgraduate course usually is. You will be informed in detail about the exact format of the same after your first year.
        </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">B. Tech. Project</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Previously a mandatory component of the B. Tech curriculum, the B. Tech. project (BTP) is now optional. The BTP is a yearlong project that allows you to have a taste of research at the undergraduate level. You can choose any sub-field in CS that interests you the most and work on a new, unsolved research problem under the guidance of a professor.
        </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">RnD Project</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          This is also an optional component. It is a semester long project that allows you to get an idea of research before taking the BTP Project. This is just a mini version of BTP Project.
        </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Seminars</h2>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          This is generally a 3 credit course picked up by students to get an idea of the research field they might be interested in. This allows you to explore your research interest in CS before seriously taking it up. Contrary to the RnD that involves "development" or programming component, seminar generally involves only literature survey.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          We start off with an introductory course which teaches programming in C++. This does not assume any prerequisite so any newbie can also learn to code. Then we dive into the department with a course on the Paradigms of Programming Languages, where you’ll learn about the various kinds of programming languages and constructs. Then we have Data Structures and Algorithms courses for those who like to brainstorm, take up a challenging problem, and solve it in a clever way. There is Discrete Structures for the maths enthusiast, and Data Analysis for the stats savvy. There are systems courses like Networks and Databases, which will teach you about things about the systems, beyond the softwares you develop. There are courses on Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Compilers, to teach you about the inner workings of the computer. There is Artificial Intelligence, to teach you how to make smart applications. Not to forget the theoretical courses on Computation theory like Logic for Computer Science and Automata Theory, for those who like the theoretical perspective of things. Beyond these core courses, the department has a lot of very interesting elective courses that you can take up. Some of the interesting courses are: Networks Security, Computer Graphics, Digital Image Processing, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing etc. The list keeps going.
        </p>
      
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">           
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Algorithms and complexity</h2>
          Ever wondered how Google Maps is able to find the quickest directions to your destination, that too, so fast? Computers of today aren’t really that smart. They can merely perform calculations faster than we can. It is the algorithms that they’re instructed with that make them seem smart. Finding directions on Google Maps, Graph Search on Facebook are all products of highly complex algorithms. Not only that, bank websites today are secure only because of the fact that no one has yet discovered an algorithm to quickly factorize a large number. Who knows, maybe you’re going to give banks a run for their money! The above examples can give a fairly good idea of the impact of research in this field. Discovery of new algorithms can expand the horizons of possibility and can make life a lot easier in the future. You will have courses in Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Design and Analysis of Algorithms as a part of your curriculum.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          This is one field that needs no introduction, thanks to the numerous Hollywood movies. Aside from machines taking over humans, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is all about making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. It is indeed one of the most exciting and actively researched fields in Computer Science. AI in itself has a number of subfields that involve Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, etc. You will have an introductory course in AI as a part of the core curriculum. A number of more advanced courses in AI are offered and may be taken up either as electives or honours or just for the heck of it.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Compilers and Programming Languages</h2>
          It might amaze a novice programmer how a Compiler is effectively able to translate a program to machine language and even point out errors in the code. This field studies the systematic translation of human-level programming languages into machine language, and clever optimizations along the way. Design of new programming languages and modifications of the existing ones are heavily influenced by the study of compilers. An introductory course in the area will set you ready for further study in the field.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Theory of Computation and logic</h2>
          This is one of most interesting fields by popular opinion. Surprising as it may seem, the most powerful computer in the world can actually be written down on paper. You will first be introduced to machines as abstract entities that can be drawn on paper through a general model of computation called an automaton. This theoretical field builds greatly on the simple models to give an in depth understanding of what computation really is. It has generated a great interest among theoreticians and can boast of a rich literature. Just throwing a buzzword - you might have heard of Turing Machines. Even if you haven’t, don’t worry - you will study them all here. This field, much like that of algorithms lends its results to other fields of computer science, one of them being artificial intelligence.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Data Security</h2>
          Data Security is all about ensuring that your data is accessed by and transmitted to only those to whom it is intended and none else. What with the NSA apparently spying on everyone, there has never been a time when there were more hot discussions about Data Security than right now and this field is predicted to explode in coming years. Data Security is commonly achieved through Cryptography. It is the modification of data in such a manner that only the intended people are able to understand it. It is an area of active research and increasingly secure and fast encryption methods constantly being developed. Although you won’t have any courses purely in Cryptography in your core curriculum, you will encounter cryptography many of the courses such as Networks, Algorithms, Architecture, etc. It is a sub-discipline in itself and there are courses in Network Security and Cryptography offered to interested students.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Computer systems</h2>
          Ever wondered how computers, the Internet, etc. work in real life? How are the instructions typed on a keyboard are actually understood, translated and executed in the form of electrical impulses? The study of Computer Systems will help you with that question. You will study operating systems, databases, embedded systems and distributed systems, etc. comprising of the major industrial fields in computer engineering and is the main application part of computer science. It involves developing hardware and software for a wide variety of systems such as computer networks (e.g. the internet), databases (used by every major company/institution for handling huge amounts of data), and operating systems (the basic software on any computer system which provides the interface between the hardware and the user). Courses in this field cover the following aspects: develop an understanding of computer architecture, the functionality of the hardware and the logic it implements. Various aspects of a computer such as memory, CPU, I/O are discussed. Understand the working of computer networks, and develop abilities to analyse them using various software tools. Understand the functionality of a database and the ways in which it handles data and develop an application for the same.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Construction Technology and Management</h2>
          The curriculum exposes the students majorly to the behavior and properties of concrete and the elements that go into forming it. Concrete in recent times is one of the most widely used construction element due to the ease in which its properties can be altered for various applications. This field will explain how minor changes in materials used and their proportions can have a large change in the final properties of concrete. Based on the courses and linked laboratory courses one can have a deep understanding of the topic and observe its effects in all constructions around us. This field is particularly emerging and interesting as different types of concrete are being made all over the world everyday based on the applications. In the management aspect one deals with planning, design, and construction of a project from its beginning to its end.

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are a CS Engineer?</h1>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Computer Science is a hot field today. There are a lot of major universities doing very good research in this field, and a lot of companies building very exciting products using it. Hence there are a lot of opportunities for both higher studies and jobs. Throughout your sophomore and junior year, you’ll have a bunch of opportunities in the summers and possibly winters to work on exciting projects at other universities, companies, and even professors inside the campus. And the department proudly boasts a near perfect placement after graduation. Numerous renowned companies come here for internships and placement. While not necessarily true, having done your B.Tech. in CSE from IITB does boost your chances of securing admission to reputed institutions for your higher studies.

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          What Computer Science is NOT? <br/> Disclaimer : Everything you read below has to be taken with a pinch of salt. Most of the things mentioned below are highly correlated with the fundamental concepts of computer science and are, by no means, any “lesser” than purely theoretical computer science concepts like complexity theory, graph theory etc.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This is not about how you’d build android applications. This is not about how to make FIFA or Counter Strike. You won’t learn how to hack into the NSA’s database or leak the next round of Panama Papers (sorry, aspiring Mr. Robots!). And you certainly won’t be the “Tech Support” of the family any more than you already are. Now, it’s probably true that your typical Computer Scientist may have more luck installing a printer driver than the typical lay person, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with their formal training in Computer Science and more to do with the fact that they (typically, but not always) just spend a lot more time dealing with computers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            “Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is about microscopes or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools, it is about how we use them and what we find out when we do.”

            <br/>
            One important thing to keep in mind is that computer science is different from computer programming. You’d spend quite some time in coding up the solutions for your assignments. But the focus would be more on the underlying math and logical reasoning rather than the programming language or framework you use.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            That being said, you certainly would have enough opportunities to explore and learn the stuff mentioned in the previous paragraphs. And in the presence of ever enthusiastic seniors, who learnt it while working on some hobby projects, or because they were too bored one fine day (read : during mid-sems/end-sems) and ended up spending the night in understanding the know-hows of that library Google just made public, rest assured that help will always be given at IIT-B to those who ask for it ;).

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          After my JEE, I chose CSE at IIT Bombay mainly because I had done some C programming classes in high school which got me interested in the field. But I quickly learned that CS is so vast and varied than simply 'programming', that even after a BTech at IITB and a Masters in CS at Stanford, I am learning exciting new things every day.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You must have already heard the clichés that this is the 'information age' or the 'digital age', 'software is eating the world', 'data is the new oil', etc. It is in fact quite true that the world has changed rapidly in the last 20 years as every industry has moved to the Internet and data/information is the new currency. CSE as a field basically encompasses anything that has to do with efficiently computing, distributing, organizing, consuming and analyzing information. It is not tied to a specific programming language, platform, OS, or technology. What an undergrad degree in Computer Science & Engineering entails, and what the IITB CSE department excels at, is providing a holistic view of this field, from both the Science (eg Data Structures, Algorithms, Discrete Maths, Theory of Computation) and Engineering (eg Databases, Operating Systems, Networks, etc) aspects. If you like maths and solving puzzles, you will most likely enjoy being in this field. In retrospect, I can confidently say that the IITB CSE faculty and curriculum is the best in India, because the high quality of teaching, depth of content as well as having the smartest classmates, provided me with a strong foundation in understanding core CS concepts, applying them in practice, and most importantly to quickly grasp new CS concepts. This enabled me to excel in industry internships as well as in grad school. Some courses in IITB CSE department are at par with the best universities in the world.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I don't need to tell you that CS is the most lucrative field right now in terms of future job prospects. This is so because it is a young field and with the advent of the 'information age' every industry is in search of good programmers. With an undergrad degree in CS under your belt, you will have many options, some of which are: work at a core tech company, go into quantitative finance, or do tech consulting. You can pursue further studies through a Masters or PhD if you want to go deep into a particular sub-field under CS. For example, I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in my MS. These will open up specialized industry positions like Data Scientist, or allow you to join academia as a professor and continue with research. Finally, the option of going for entrepreneurship is always open, since a CS undergrad is ideal for a CTO in any startup, who has to architect and manage the entire tech infrastructure of a company.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Overall, my way of thinking and approach to solving problems are greatly shaped by my years at IITB CSE. Any good engineer must learn to tackle new problems and design novel solutions. The fun part about CS is that the world of bits is abstract and complex, and much more varied than the world of atoms. It is not bound by the laws of physics like other more traditional types of engineering. But a great CS engineer is one who can simultaneously reason with abstract concepts and real world systems, and design simple yet optimal solutions to complex problems (in other words, someone who is a natural 'hacker'). If that is you, what are you waiting for? Take the plunge...

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Vishnu Vinjam, CSE B.Tech (2014)</h2>
              <b/>Brief Intro:<b/> <br/>
              This is Vishnu Vinjam, brought up in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh with my JEE coaching in Hyderabad and finally a proud graduate of Computer Science Department of IIT Bombay. Currently I am working as an Engineer with Samsung Electronics in Suwon, South Korea. My passions include travelling, writing, books and movies. In my personal time, I juggle responsibilities as Vice President of IIT Alumni Association in Korea and as mentor to IITB social group Abhyuday.
                <br/>
                <br/>
              <b>Why Computer Science?</b><br/>
              I had a pretty good JEE rank and had almost all branches and IIT’s open to me. Just as many of you are right now and will be for many more years coming, I was not clear as to what I wanted to be in future. I wasn’t clear either on which profession I would like to be in or the kind of engineer I want to shape myself into. But one thing I was very clear was I wanted to be with the best people and in a department that offers flexibility. With this background I approached seniors; spoke to couple of relatives, read couple of blogs and forums. To be honest all of that didn’t help; seniors were just in their sophomore year so couldn’t give me the kind of perspective I wanted, none of my relatives were IITians and the forums back in 2010 weren’t that informative. But these days’ forums like these are very useful to get a perspective on what each department has to offer and what opportunities lie ahead after graduating. Use them to the fullest. My eventual choice boiled down to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; Bombay or Delhi and finally I walked in to CSE, IIT Bombay.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>Surprises?</b><br/>
              I had no clue what computer science was, I never coded or wrote computer programmes before. I did play pc games and used Photoshop; but they don’t count. All I knew was CS was logical, involves math and you can create Facebook or Google with it. With four years behind me now I can say that CS is fun, logical, involves math (as much as you choose to have i.e. depends on the field you choose) and you can get job in FB, Google or Samsung; or create your own Next Big Thing.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>What freshers can expect?</b><br/>
              Every freshman has a compulsory course on computer programming which will give one a taste of what it is to write code and program. Mind you that almost every student in an engineering field has to write code at some point or other. It could be to simulate real-world-conditions to save time and money by not having to build huge, unnecessary labs or test environments. It could be to run your engine or communication system or a robot or a car you built, programming is everywhere. What CS students do is to really take that discipline forward in to all the frontiers and systems and to it’s depths. Programming is fun and doesn’t need any prior knowledge or experience. There is no inherent advantage to someone who wrote his first C or Java program in 8th standard. First year gives you a brief introduction to Computer Science, with second year expanding to part theoretical and part general. Third year is when real fun begins with core concepts like Networks, Databases, Operating Systems are covered; laying out the breadth of the department to students. Fourth year is full of electives, where you can handpick courses so that you could choose which fields you want to learn more and grow in. Computer Science department in IIT Bombay has some of the best faculty in the institute, course structure is flexible with plenty of choice and opportunities to do additional courses or research under professors.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>Exciting areas in the Field?</b><br/>
              Computer Science is a vast field stretching from its mathematical roots i.e. theoretical and research oriented to the day-to-day aspects like websites, mobile apps and applications. Those with inclination towards math can find plenty of opportunities both in academia and software companies. One can also choose to go to software development creating applications and tools that we use day to day with companies or start-ups.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>After CSE, IITB?</b><br/>
              Computer Science has some of the best opportunities post IIT. There are plenty of opportunities to pursue higher education like Masters or PhD programmes both in India, US and best universities around the world. Jobs in most global companies like FB, Google, Samsung, MS etc are open to graduates. Locations are both in India and outside; I myself am based in South Korea. There are lot of entrepreneurial opportunities too, in the form of co-founders, CTo (Chief Technology Officers), engineers etc. Lot of our alumni have set up companies including some big names like Ola, Housing and many more new ones have been raising large money to kick-start their ventures. You could also do an MBA right after college or few years down the line; take up Consulting positions, jobs in trading, banks and financial institutions too.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>What all I was involved in at IITB?</b><br/>
              In addition to my course work in CSE department I completed a minor in Humanities and Social Sciences with courses in Sociology, Psychology and Literature. I was part of NSS and co-founded a social club called ‘Samwad’. In my final year I launched with an amazing team first of its kind two day social festival called ‘Abhyuday’ with an aim to build future leaders for solving our nations problems.
              <br/>
              <br/>

              <b>What are my plans?</b><br/>
              I am happy with the work I do in and for Samsung now and would continue for some time till another brilliant opportunity comes knocking. I have an MBA in sights, but could as well skip that for a startup or create something of my own. Let’s hope one day you can pick up a book with my name on from a roadside bookstore; which is my version of fancy dream.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>What CSE Department taught me?</b><br/>
              It taught me honesty, openness to work in teams and collaborate with others. It encourages one to share, create open source materials for everyone’s benefit. It forces one to think logically, structure thoughts and be a continuous learner. While these apply to every department and field, Computer Science in my view takes the cake because of its online communities, open source resources and myriad opportunities it offers.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>What IITB taught me?</b><br/>
              IIT Bombay is my home and it shaped me in countless big and small ways. It is an experience that I will carry along to my grave. Amazing friendships I have had, things I could create and leave behind, loads of mindless fun that I rejoice even today are all because of it. It was a melting pot of people from all walks of life, all parts of the country; a truly diverse, talented and driven set of people. And Bombay is a living breathing city with its own quirks and idiosyncrasies.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>Final Words</b><br/>
              While entering IIT or your department might seem to be the end of life, to be honest it ain’t so. Though you might miss out on your department in counselling, you have the option of Branch Change. If you end up in a department you don’t like, you could do minor courses or additional courses in the department you prefer. In addition to this you could make a shift in your masters or PhD programme in case. I have had a senior who moved from Electrical Engineering (DD) to a PhD in Biology straight out of college; crazy it might sound, but doable. You could also do internships in your choice of work and do academic projects under profs in IIT B or other institutions and build up your profile.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If all seem to not work, then go out and create something of your own and be next Narayan Murthy or Zuckerberg whoever you prefer. But one thing that you should not forget in all this is that you have done brilliant work to make it to this stage. You have worked hard, made your family and teachers proud and friends jealous. You are talented and can surmount any challenge that you come across in life. Be confident and all the very best to your future endeavours.

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          The device you are currently viewing this website on, the server you are downloading data from, the cables that are transporting these little packets over miles, these are all possible because of years of cumulative electrical engineering genius. Electrical Engineering is a very diverse branch where you can choose to work on nanoscale devices or build and optimise giant GPU server farms or increase the efficiency of mobile communication. Not only is Electrical Engineering one of the oldest departments at IIT Bombay but it can now boast of being one of the largest in the institute too.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Electrical Engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          IIT Bombay has a department of Electrical Engineering which encompasses microelectronics, communications, power systems and power electronics, control and signal processing. This does away with having separate departments like Electronics and Communication which is common in Indian universities.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The never-ending demand for faster and efficient processors has been driving innovation in the field of microelectronics. Companies like Intel, NVIDIA and AMD bring out new and better processors and GPUs year after year. The main focus of this field is to design better semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors), which serve as the building blocks, and arranging them to design a processor.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Year after year, the technology in communications have evolved like 3G, 4G etc. Wireless technologies have improved, increasing internet traffic has been dealt with, data transmission rates have increased. These are some of the things done in the field of Communications.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In just the last few years, we have witnessed Facebook automatically recognizing faces, Google using voice searches, smart cameras coming up, improved CT scans, fingerprint matching technologies etc. All these technological advancements have been made possible by contribution from signal processing engineers. Signal processing focusses on smart acquisition of data, quantifying the amount of information in the signal, reducing noise and analyzing data. Some applications include face recognition, speech recognition, biometric security like fingerprint matching. This field has some overlap with the Computer Science Department.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">           
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">B.Tech Program</h2>
          The department offers a four year Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) program (comprising of eight semesters).The curriculum is designed to give you exposure to a wide spectrum of related fields. Core courses in Telecommunications, Microelectronics and VLSI design, Power Electronics and Power System, Control System and Embedded Systems help give a B.Tech. student an overview of all areas in the EE department. Further, by pursuing an Honours (taking extra Post Graduate level courses) or in the course of the final year project, B.Tech students have the opportunity to specialize to some extent in the area of their interest. In addition to theory courses, laboratory courses also make sure that the student gets hands-on experience with digital and analog electronics, motors and microprocessors. The undergraduate students can also undertake various research projects either through Supervised Research Exposition (SRE) or through the BTech Project.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Honors in Electrical Engineering</h2>
          A B.Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honors in Electrical Engineering” when she/he has done a certain number of courses from the honors course list of the Department over and above the normal credit requirement. The exact details of the programme are clearly specified in the Academic Rulebook of the Institute. The department has a fairly flexible honors program allowing the choice of a great number of courses for Honors requirements. All EE Post Graduate level courses, as well as a few allied courses from the Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, MEMS (Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science) and IEOR (Industrial Engineering and Operations Research) departments are included in the Honors List too.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Dual Degree Programme</h2>
          The Dual Degree Programme in EE at IITB is offered in the specializations mentioned below:
          <br/>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>CSP (Communication and Signal Processing)</li>
            <li>Control and Computing</li>
            <li>Power engineering and Power systems</li>
            <li>Integrated Circuits and Systems</li>
            <li>Electronic Systems</li>
            <li>Solid State Devices</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It involves doing an extra course over and above the normal B.Tech curriculum (without Honours) each semester starting from the 3rd semester. Most of these courses are electives which can be chosen from a large basket of courses pertaining to that specialization. In addition, the final fifth year is to be devoted almost solely to the Dual Degree Project that is aimed to give the student a flavor of graduate level research in that field.
          
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>    
          <b>First Year</b> : Curriculum is almost the same for all departments. The common courses that you will do on Math, Modern Physics, Computer programming will be quite useful for the subsequent years.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the <b>second</b> and <b>third</b> year, you will do a few courses from each subfield. This would help you discover the areas that you have a liking towards. You will learn basics about electronic devices, computer architecture, circuits,control systems, communication, signal processing and transmission methods. Also by the end of the third year, you would have done some Math courses (on probability, transforms etc) that would help you in the courses you take later. Almost all core courses will be over by the end of the third year.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The rest of the coursework involves electives. Through these electives you can choose to study advanced topics in the following sub-fields:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Microelectronics</b> : Designing a processor, Building nanoscale devices, designing circuits on small chips for different applications, developing sensors etc. Quite a few courses in this area involve concepts of Physics, mainly quantum physics.
          <br/>
          <b>Communications</b> : Transmission and Reception of data, Understanding internet network, wireless technology, 3G/4G communication technology. These courses involve applications of probability and combinatorics.
          <br/>
          <b>Signal Processing</b> : There are several courses that involve Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization which have applications like face recognition, voice recognition, motion detection, data compression etc. This field has some overlap with computer science topics. This area will involve coding that you will gradually learn through these courses.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Fourth year : It is very flexible, most of the curriculum comprising electives. Choosing your own electives provides you the freedom to either dive deeper in a particular area or to pursue multiple areas.

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>    
          Here is some more information on the different fields in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay:
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Microelectronics and VLSI Design:</h2>
          This field refers to the design of circuits and devices that power the latest slim smartphones, the next generation processors. Work in this area can be categorized into device level, circuit level work and processor level work. Microelectronics and VLSI is one of the two DD specializations offered by the EE department at IIT Bombay.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The courses in the devices area (Microelectronics) cover the following aspects:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Understanding the physics behind electron transport</li>
            <li>Understanding how electronic devices like transistors work</li>
            <li>Modelling and simulating newer designs for the next generation devices which would be of the nanometre scale</li>
            <li>Fabrication of devices designed in silicon or polymers</li>
            <li>Designing sensors for a variety of applications</li>
          </ul>
          Microelectronics has a big overlap with physics. If you are interested, you can take multiple courses from the Physics department to get a better perspective of device functioning.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          VLSI is an abbreviation for Very Large Scale Integration which refers to the millions of transistors that are put together in the form of digital and analog circuits on a chip to perform some functionality.
          <br/>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Digital Circuit Design</li>
            <li>Analog and Mixed Signal VLSI Circuit Design</li>
            <li>RF Circuit (High frequency) design</li>
            <li>VLSI CAD (Computer Aided Design - Developing tools for designing multi million transistor circuits)</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          The courses in the processor area cover the following aspects:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Processor Designing (you can learn how to design a good processor and will be able to think how to design 8085, ARM).</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture (role of each functional block in a multi-core processor.</li>
            <li>Testing and verification of VLSI circuits.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          IITB has one of the only two nanofabrication facilities in India. You have professors here, who are working on cool projects like making night vision IR goggles for the Indian Army, or sensors to detect TNT (explosives). There have also been advances in application of electrical engineering in biology. There are courses on bio-sensors and neuromorphic engineering (the IBM ‘brain chip’) for gaining insights into these topics.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Power Electronics and Power Systems</h2>
          Future is energy, and that’s what this aspect of EE focuses on. Whatever be the source of energy, it is converted into Electrical energy which is easier to transmit as well as use. This field concentrates on improving the conversion mechanisms and the transmission.
                <br/>
                <br/>
          What you can expect from courses in this area:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Designing efficient motors and electricity generators</li>
            <li>How to use renewable energy - solar cells, wind energy</li>
            <li>Manage power plants and analyze power distribution systems (the power grid)</li>
          </ul>
              <br/>
          With the advent of smart grids, power has become more ‘intelligent’ in the recent past, and Power Systems has been drifting closer and closer to Communication Systems and Microelectronics to cater to the needs of the world better.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Control and Computing</h2>
          Control systems are designed to regulate, monitor and precisely control the behavior of systems in nature or any device. An example of a control system would be the system used to track satellites or a system that automatically closes or opens a dam based on water levels. The Controls and computing group investigates the theoretical and algorithmic principles underlying modern electrical engineering to solve problems. Courses would focus on design of Controls Systems, Matrix computations and Linear Algebra, Network Theory, Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory.
              <br/>
              <br/>
          A blend of concepts from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, courses in Controls and Computing often see great relevance in many interdisciplinary areas, and many concepts are often drawn upon in a wide variety of fields ranging from aerodynamics to game theory, and beyond. For example, any stable system requires to be based on sound control theory concepts - be it a million node circuit, or a pencil balanced on a ruler. This branch of Electrical Engineering goes hand-in-hand with the others, and is viewed upon as a necessary complement to the rest of Electrical engineering

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Electronic Systems</h2>
          This group deals with application oriented systems with integrated and(or) embedded electronics. The washing machine that’s programmable, or the mobile phone that comes with an inbuilt blood pressure sensor. The group is closely connected with the Microelectronics and Signal processing groups, testing out ideas and making complete products. In the freshman year, this is the group you’ll be encountering most, whether it may be the Department Introductory Course, or the Electrified sessions that you will have in the Wadhwani Electronics Laboratory.
              <br/>
              <br/>
          The group also works on making devices that can help hearing impaired people speak, using a blend of Speech processing techniques and Electronic hardware. Another project undertaken by the group includes an ECG sensor which immediately calls for help using a mobile phone if the user has a heart attack. This group also has a really cool haptic tool, that can help you feel virtual textures, as well as program them. This is being used to preserve in virtual space, ancient monuments of importance and thus preserving our cultural heritage.

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are an Electrical Engineer?</h1>
        
      There is a lot research going on in the fields mentioned above. The curriculum allows students to explore the areas through electives and projects. Quite a lot of students who are interested in research go for MS/PhD in their area of interest at prestigious universities. There is a significant overlap with Computer science in some fields, so some of the students also go for MS in a field of Computer Science.
              <br/>
              <br/>
      During placements, there are companies that require engineers for the subfields mentioned above. Therefore, those who wish to get some industry exposure choose to take jobs in core sector which are available through placements.
              <br/>
              <br/>
      The type of mathematics used in the field of Electrical Engineering is quite similar to what is required for jobs in Finance sector. This enables students to easily switch to finance sector if they wish and use their mathematical skills in the area of finance.
        

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Additional information</h1>
        Some students feel that Electrical Engineering is all about circuits. This is false as it has subdivisions (like Signal processing, communication) which involve very less of circuits. In 12th standard, Semiconductors is taught in school. Some students do not like it and consider not taking electrical because of that. All that stuff is taught again at IIT in a much more interesting way. Also, the study of semiconductors constitutes only a part of Electrical engineering. There are subfields that are completely independent of it.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Parthe Pandit, Dual Degree (CSP) – 2015</h2>
                This blogpost is organized year-wise, freshie-sophie-thirdie-fourthie, and is meant to be read by a freshie starting his life at EE@IITB. Sophomores who have BC-ed (Branch-changed) into EE are welcome to go through this to know what they have missed. I have tried to jot down the experiences and expertise an EE student might be expected to gain by the end of each year. I have also mentioned my (physical) interactions with the department in the first 4 of the 5 years I spent in the EE department. A disclaimer regarding the information in the blogpost is due at this point since the curriculum may have undergone changes since I was a student. In case you are a Dual Degree student the only thing that differs is that (i) you have to do a Dual Degree project (DDP) in your fifth year and (ii) your specialization is already decided at the time of admission whereby you have to do a specialization course of your choice every semester from the second year onwards.
                <br/>
                <br/>
               <b> First Year:</b><br/>
                The interaction of a freshie with the department as such is minimal. There are only two courses EE101 and EE102, one in each semester, which try to introduce each of the 5 areas mentioned above (and beyond) and motivate you to study and excel in Electrical Engineering in the years to come. There may a brief description of the history and evolution of Electrical Engineering. Although this last bit seems boring to listen to in a classroom, especially when you are expecting stuff like wireless charging, humanoids and what not, it makes you more aware regarding the field and often also makes for an interesting conversation outside the classroom, especially during placements.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are no lab courses in the department in the first year, which may make you think that you are not getting a "feel" for what you are studying. But trust me, you are in for way too many lab courses to compensate for this in the years to come.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At the end of the year, you should have a good feel for what Electrical Engineering is about. An electrician can no longer fool you by saying "3-phase DC induction motor lagyenge toh acha rahega" or that the 3 pins at a plug point are in fact a 3 phase supply. You should also have gained enough knowledge to tinker around with electronic devices on your own, understand specifications mentioned on most gadgets, know if a charger will reduce the battery life of your phone or laptop, or how using spike guards in series may be a tad bit flimsier than an extension board. The list is endless.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To those of you who know of Kung-fu-Panda.. "There is now a Level 0!" (EN...)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Second Year:</b><br/>
                As a sophie, the courses are more narrowed down than the broad courses studied in the previous year. Obviously, there will now be labs for courses which are not theoretical and for which the level 0 has actually been attained. Broadly speaking, you may be expected to understand certain principles of design and finally appreciate the difference between engineering and science. The lab courses teach you a lot. There will always be a way to free ride on the efforts of your labmates, but it is really worth the while to put in effort to see a system work on a bread-board. You will realize that a simulation always differs from the actual hardware and last but not the least - you will, probably, have also learnt how to debug a hardware system, rather than jump to naive speculations of "bread-board kharab hoga". (ENGI...)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Third Year:</b><br/>
                By the beginning of third year, you will have spent two academic years and two summer vacations as an IITian doing something either you like or realizing what you aren’t fond of. You will also probably have found out if you are still interested in Electrical Engineering, in which case you should probably look for "core internships". Depending on this you will take courses which are either (i) meant for learning or (ii) well-known for "peace" grading.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Nevertheless, the core courses in the third year are typically intermediate level courses. Again, one course for each of the 5 streams. As expected, they will again be accompanied by labs so that what is learnt in class is hoped to be observed/applied on hardware. Before you leave for your internship, it is worth asking the question "what do I expect to learn/gain out of this experience?" (ENGINE... now you know what this really is..!)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Fourth Year:</b><br/>
                The fourth year brings with it some apprehension. If it doesn't, good for you! It certainly did for me. At this point in your life at IIT Bombay, you are (or you think you are) the "Master of your domain" so there is no point writing a lot about the fourth year. A wing senior is probably a more reliable person to give you fundae at this point.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                By now, you have settled at IITB, and you will probably be anxious about answering the questions "What’s next?" and "What is my passion?" and so on, while your hair starts greying, or worse balding, to thinking about MBA-MS/PhD-Job-Startup-UPSC and what not!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You have to choose a specialization in Electrical Engineering. If you're interested you will take up a B.Tech project (BTP) for which you will have to choose an advisor and so on. Since the courses are typically specialization courses from one of the 5 streams, you will probably not do them with your wingies and hence make new friends whom you didn't know until now. More advanced the course are, say 5xx or 6xx, more the number of assignments you will be given in a week. Although to tell you the truth the most I learnt during my IIT days was when I solved these assignments.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                (voila.. ENGINEER :D)<br/>
                To think of it, my 6 years at IITB have flown by faster than I would have liked. EE@IITB, though not as flashy as the hostels or the SAC, is a wonderful place where your brilliant minds will flourish. Who knows you could be the next Shannon! Good Luck.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Gururaj Saileshwar, Dual Degree (Micro) – 2014</h2>

                Like you, I am entering a new phase of my life- joining Georgia Tech in August,2016 as a PhD student in Computer Architecture. Since joining IIT-Bombay in 2009, I have had some diverse experiences - from being deeply interested in academics at IIT-B, to exploring the world of management consulting at Boston Consulting Group, to finally exploring a life in academia as a research scholar at Georgia Tech. Hopefully my experiences can give you some insight into what is in store for you – if you pick EE, IITB.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At IIT-Bombay, the Electrical Engineering Department provided me an excellent environment to thrive academically. The diverse set of courses available at EE, IITB straddling physics & chemistry (semiconductor physics), maths (communication & signal processing) and Computer Science (VLSI & Computer Architecture), allowed me to explore different sub-fields. In addition, the department has a culture encouraging research among undergrads. Opportunities for research with professors came in multiple formats - summer projects, in-semester research based courses, bachelors/master's theses projects. These allowed me to decide whether I liked doing research & the areas I liked & disliked. Lastly the professors & peer group at EE, IITB are probably one of the best in the country – they bring out the best in you academically.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition, I cannot stress how important the extra-curricular experiences at IITB have been in shaping my outlook towards life. Some of my most important life lessons have been learnt during my time working with the mentorship programme at IITB, or while training with the swimming team. Rest assured, there are enough extra-curricular opportunities at IITB to pursue whatever hobbies that suit one's interests – ensuring one gets a well-rounded preparation towards success in life.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Parth Kothari, B Tech (2018)</h2>

                  Hey People, if you got a rank in JEE Advanced good enough to consider IITB EE, Heartiest Congratulations! :D
                  <br/><br/>

                  So, when I was in your place, 4 years ago, there were predominantly 3 questions going through my mind.
                  <br/><br/>

                  Why IITB-EE? (How does it compare to other universities and other branches)
                  <br/>
                  What do I expect in my 4 years in the EE Department?
                  <br/>
                  How hard or easy are things going to be?
                  <br/>
                  There is one more question which I felt should have come in my mind but it came after I finished my B.Tech. I will come to it at the end.
                  <br/><br/>

                  So coming to the first question. <b>Why IITB-EE?</b>

                <br/><br/>
                  How does IIT EE stand in front of the other EE departments in India?
                  <br/>
                  After talking to all my friends from other universities during the course of my 4 yrs, I would bluntly assert that the level of education you get in IIT is incomparable to the other universities. So, academically you will be very well placed in your life. It is very important to realize this fact, we often forget that we are getting the best education in India.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Coming to the EE as a branch, you might be wondering, is Mechanical (just taking it as an example) better or is Electrical better? You might be thinking that in JEE, I didn’t like transistors but I liked the Laws of Motion, so maybe Mech suits me more. (I had thought this thing while deciding :P). Well, here’s the thing. Most of you (having the above thoughts) have NO Idea what these fields comprise of and that is what you are going to learn in the course of your next 4 / 5 years ! So, my advice would be - If you have a preference which you love, say Aero, then GO FOR IT! But only a few must have developed that passion in life (My observations in life). Word of Caution - There is a difference between liking a field and studying the engineering aspects of it. Otherwise, I would suggest to choose the branch according to your rank. Because the hierarchy has been formed following the trends in future demand, placements etc. To ascertain my opinion, if I had a younger sibling, who had no particular liking, I would have advised him to take the branch according to his rank.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  This brings me to my second question. <b>What can I expect in my 4 years in EE Department?</b>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>

                  In one word, EVERYTHING! IITB EE is not just about academics, it is about a way of life! It’s about studying one day before the exams with the best of your friends, it’s about learning from the best in the field, it’s about learning to struggle to get a bragging-worthy internship, its about staying awake to complete your projects before deadlines, and so on.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>

                  The website gives a very detailed account of the coursework you will go through during your undergraduate studies. I won’t focus on that. EE is about the exploration of vast breadth of this field from understanding the movement of electrons in the transistors to understanding images to understanding how cellular communication works! But with great expanse comes great amount of coursework and lab work :P So yeah, the curriculum is relatively bigger compared to some of the other branches but the knowledge gained is worth it. You get exposed to different subfields, providing more options to pursue and 4 years is enough to help you select what you want to “pursue” after your B.Tech. And my favorite part - many of the students from the EE department go for internships abroad or in top companies in Bangalore, an opportunity not available outside. So yeah, that’s really Cool! You learn a lot more out there in the real field than in your classroom.
                  <br/><br/>

                  So finally <b>How hard or easy are things going to be?</b>
                  <br/><br/>

                  Okay, the first thing a senior told to me before I was about to enter IIT - “Whoever told you that life is chill after JEE lied to you.” Well, he was correct. I was lucky enough not to take it in the wrong way. People, the main learning of IIT happens in the everyday stuff. Living in the hostel on your own, disciplining yourself to study before the exams with no one to keep you in check, going out there and fighting for a job/ internship - These are all the valuable lessons I have learnt in life, more valuable than things learnt in the classroom. So yes, it won’t be THAT easy. There will be some struggles but I bet that you will come out a much stronger and brighter personality.
                  <br/><br/>

                  Regarding the question to your struggles in EE, well it’s almost the same as for other branches. If you have greater ambitions, you will have to fight more. Finally, it’s up to you how badly you want something :)
                  <br/><br/>

                  And the one final question, which I asked myself after IITB EE. <b>Is it WORTH it?</b>
                  <br/><br/>

                  All I will say is this - If I was put back in your stage of life, with no preferences for any field, I would, without a second thought, rush inside that lush green campus of Life AGAIN. Yes, having had my fair share of experiences over the 4 years, I would certainly change a few habits/decisions I made during my stay but I would want to be a part of IITB EE again.
                  <br/><br/>

                  So hey, if you read till here, Thanks a LOT :D Hope my views helped you in getting a clarity regarding what you want to pursue as well as what to expect in IITB EE. Please do take reviews from other seniors into consideration as well before finalizing your decision.
                  <br/><br/>
                    
                  Best of Luck for your journey through Life!
                  <br/>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Shalaka Kulkarni, B Tech (2018)</h2>
                  
                  IITB, for me, has truly been a journey of self-discovery. I entered IIT Bombay with a top-100 AIR at the JEE, having chosen EE at IITB over the popular trend of CSE at IITD and other institutes. While it is difficult to choose one’s branch with little to no prior knowledge of engineering, EE at IITB provides the perfect platform for students of all talents and dreams to achieve their potential. The intellectually challenging courses, experiential learning of labs, dedicated and encouraging professors, and brilliant peer group make for a perfect academic environment that inculcates a quest for knowledge and a pursuit of excellence. The myriad extracurricular opportunities both within and outside the department, from technical and cultural fests to organizational leadership, allow one to develop the various facets of one’s personality. Electrical Engineering helps develop the talent, skills and perspectives for students of this department to excel in diverse fields, from core research to corporate life.
                  <br/><br/>

                  It was in EE at IITB that I discovered a passion for hands-on electronics and became an active member of the student-led Electronics Club. It was in this department that I had the chance to experiment with various research fields, from semiconductor devices to communications and image processing. The encouragement of professors and flexibility of the department helped me develop an active extracurricular profile, becoming Manager of Projects in the Technical Council and taking on mentorship roles. It gave me a unique platform to represent IITB at national and international conferences. The strong quantitative background and critical thinking skills developed through challenging courses in the department have created a solid foundation for future careers in finance and consulting. Above all, it is the spirit of excellence inculcated by EE at IITB that will be my most lasting takeaway from the four rewarding years in this department.
                  <br/><br/>

                  For anyone looking to discover their passion and pursue their dreams, Electrical Engineering at IITB is the place to be.

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
          The Department of Energy Science and Engineering (DESE) has a vision to develop sustainable energy systems and solutions for future energy needs of the world in general and India in particular. Established as the interdisciplinary Energy Systems Engineering programme in 1981, it was upgraded to a full-fledged department in 2007. It is one of the very few departments in India to cater to the challenges specific to the energy sector. Here's link to our department website:

        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Energy Science and Engineering all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">           
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Energy Science</h2>
          Involves various sciences which are related to and important for Energy Engineering. For e.g. Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Structural Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Material Science and Basics of Electrical Engineering such as Electrical Machines and Power Electronics

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Energy Engineering</h2>
          Involves application of the concepts learnt in courses related to Energy Science to specific areas such as renewable power generation, energy storage, energy transmission and load scheduling etc. It involves the interplay of concepts from one or more energy sciences as energy systems are itself interdisciplinary in nature.
            <br/><br/>
          Under renewable power generation we may have solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, wind energy, nuclear energy, fuel cells, hydrogen energy etc. Energy storage involves storage in form of thermal (solar thermal) or electrochemical energy (batteries) whereas energy transmission requires knowledge of electrical transmission systems. Energy Engineering also involves few basic concepts of economics, finance and resource engineering to help individuals choose between various available options for energy systems and appropriate allocation of resources and time to all available players respectively to have an optimal energy system.

            Diversity of our Department
          </div>
          <br/><br/>
          The Department of Energy Science and Engineering (DESE) offers a Dual Degree Program (B-tech in Energy Engineering + M-Tech in Energy Systems Engineering) to 30 of the JEE entrants of IIT-Bombay. As summarized in the chart, DESE is a vastly diverse department which is a blend of some aspects of each of Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical and Material Science Departments modified to cater to the challenges thrown at engineers due to ever increasing relevance of renewable energy in the world. Due to its small strength per undergrad batch (30), the faculty-student ratio is quite high which a huge bonus is.
          
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>    
          While the first year is basically involved in consolidating basic knowledge in calculus, physics, chemistry and biology (like every other department). The second year lays down the basic foundation in all the four major areas which are Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics, Systems & Controls, Structures and Propulsion. The third year involved deeper understanding of all the four areas. This is when you’re exposed to a lot of experimental and laboratory work, which gives you an exciting perspective into how these things fit into the real world applications of Aerospace. The fourth year gives your entire experience a closure by having an Aircraft Design exercise where you apply all the knowledge that you’ve gained through the four years of learning in the department to create a technologically-viable aerospace product of your own. The department is very well-suited for pursuing research in any of these fronts. Most people opt for a Supervised Learning Program and B.Tech Projects to get their hands dirty with core research in aerospace.

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What courses would you be required to take up?</h1>    
          As mentioned above, two lines of courses are offered which are related to Energy Sciences and those related to Energy Engineering. Apart from the core courses (compulsory courses), as per the curriculum the students of DESE are required to do a few electives. It is in these electives where the energy engineering or application part comes in. Most of the core courses are courses related to energy sciences:
          <br/><br/>
          <b>1st year:</b> First year courses are common for the entire undergrad batch except for the Department introductory course which is in the 2nd semester for DESE students. The first year courses are mostly related to basic sciences (physics, math, chemistry, biology (yes bio too!! just to make you a well-rounded individual)). There are also a few courses such as workshop, engineering drawing, physics lab, chemistry lab where we are taught some basic engineering skills which every engineer should possess irrespective of his/ her field of study. In the Department introductory course you will be taught in general about various types of Renewable systems, about energy resources and a bit of energy economics. It will be a perfect trailer for the movie ahead.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>2nd year:</b> From 2nd year onwards, you will start having your own department courses. In the second year you will be taught a few of the energy science related courses such as mechanics of materials, material science, thermodynamics, Transport phenomena( essentially fluid mechanics+ heat transfer+ mass transfer) ,electrical machines, basic electrical and electronics engineering etc. Note that most of these courses are vast in themselves but they have been modified to suit the needs of energy engineers and are taught accordingly. You will also have a lab which will teach you to handle electrical equipments. In order to widen the curriculum we also have courses from environment and economics. In this year you will have one engineering related course: energy resources, economics and environment and another course from math’s department namely numerical analysis which is a must for most engineers.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>3rd year:</b> It offers a blend of energy science and energy engineering courses. You will have some energy science courses based on power electronics, combustion and labs related to these courses. Most of the courses will be engineering related such as power systems, reaction engineering, thermos-fluid devices, thermal and fluid engineering lab, solar lab, power generation and system planning etc. You will also be required to take 2 electives (of course of your choice from the list) which can be science or engineering based as per your interests. In the 5th semester you will be required to do a course from philosophy, literature, psychology, sociology which will be interesting (believe me!!) and it is compulsory for the entire institute.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>4th year:</b> In the 4th year you will have very few core courses but you will be required to do a plethora of electives. Most of the electives for our department are courses which are advanced level courses of the energy science courses or are application based energy engineering courses such as solar photovoltaics, wind energy, nuclear energy, fuel cells, hydrogen energy, waste to energy, electrochemical energy storage solar thermal, microgrids etc. The core courses will be related to energy systems modelling, optimization and to energy management. Note that most of the electives (if application based) have a course project which makes the course interesting and updates you with the latest research in that field. Apart from these you will be required to do a seminar (it basically teaches you to conduct literature survey for research and you are guided by a professor on the topic that you choose from the topics that have been floated), innovation lab and energy design project which are project based courses and teach you to apply your learnt concepts to solve a problem of not only academic but also industrial relevance.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>5th year:</b> You are required to do 2 electives and a dual degree project (DDP). The dual degree project is basically research work and you present your thesis at the end of the year. In your DDP you will be guided by a professor (mostly from DESE, but you may have a co-guide from other department) whom you choose as your guide and it is an integral part of the dual degree program across all departments. It is just like the M-tech thesis that master students are required to submit at the end of their tenure.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are an Energy Science Engineer?</h1>
        
        I think that energy department is quite different from other engineering departments: in the way that the breadth our department offers is quite vast, and much of it is left for a student to discover via the electives. A student can develop his degree according to general fields and profiles they're yearning for.
        <br/><br/>
        As far as the options go, I think one of the options which a student can choose is further research. Our department is lucky in that easy, because many of the fields involved bin energy are very quickly moving and upcoming. Fields like material science related to PV and electrochemical devices is going to remain very hot, and fields like fluid-thermal engineering are still evergreen with all the new kinds of improvements and operation in power plants and hot/cold fluid storage systems. With added renewables and new kind of devices, incorporating these in the grid is also getting a lot of attention.
        <br/><br/>
        Apart from research, most students who want to go for jobs after being an energy engineer are also various. There are noncore jobs which don't really much depend on engineering, so these are kind of common and dependent on how student chooses to develop themselves over their stay at IITB kind of apart from just the department. These may include profiles like finance. Then there are coding profiles, about which I would say our department doesn't really have much coding involved in the compulsory curriculum nor is it present in many of the electives, so a student has to develop those skills if they wish for and are interested in such profile.
        <br/><br/>
        Then there are consulting jobs, where although a student would have to prepare by themselves for these, some courses in our department, even compulsory courses, share a DNA of analyzing complicated systems, not always involving just scientific and engineering elements but social aspects as well, and that would certainly be beneficial and a student can pursue such a path.
        <br/><br/>
        On a slightly similar note, impact of various policies is also discussed here and there, and (may not be immediately or of the campus) one can also try and get into policy making, especially by taking some courses/projects in CTARA which are related. This kind of thinking mechanism is also helpful in some parts of Management, and a student can choose to work in the field of energy (or some other field) after pursuing management after the degree.
        <br/><br/>
        As for the core jobs, there are many startups coming up in the field of especially renewables, microgrids etc., and students can look forward to those (or they can form their own startups and look forward to recruiting other students! :P). There's research going on in the topics mentioned some paragraphs ago in big companies as well.
        <br/><br/>
        The main caveat here is that many companies etc yet do not know about our department and program, so they will need some convincing and trying before they give us a thought, but the situation is slowly improving: many companies are knowing our department either directly, or as many other colleges start their programs (not always necessarily through an independent department though) are becoming accustomed to there existing a program in energy (Just that this process is very slow).
        

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Additional information</h1>
        <b>Q:</b> As an energy engineer, I don't really see how all of this applies to my own life: the power plants, and grid and everything seems so distant from my life! How is energy engineering affecting me directly (not via the way of government decisions and policies and power plant operations etc, which I as a person can't really control)?
      <br/><br/>
        <b>A:</b> While it is true that energy engineering involves decisions and operations of big huge things such as various powerplants, the grid of a whole region or nation, or the nationwide policies etc, you can definitely see energy engineering right from your home and daily activities, you just have to know how to look for it. I will present some examples, but they are by no means all-encompassing, so feel free to discover more for yourself! One of the things where you can apply energy engineering can be when you are setting up solar PV on your rooftop and designing that system for your home. Even this may seem distant. But there are things to ponder about even from one's daily life. Take an example of cooking, which is an activity performed in every household. Cooking involves usually combusting gas supplied by your gas company, and the food is cooked. Now some of us use wood instead, and combusting gas and combusting wood are quite different, and require different stoves. Also, these stoves can be improved by minimising the heat wastage by catering the size and shape of the stove, and especially in case of stoves using wood, trying to achieve a cleaner combustion. This is one area where the improvement can directly affect you and your household. Another thing which can be analyzed from energy perspective is your electricity usage. This problem may become much more interesting in the future when time based tariff may be applied. Then you can identify the devices which are consuming most of the electricity, and identify whether they need repairs or servicing - if they're consuming much more than intended, or choose an alternative which will result in minimum energy consumption while buying something. Another area which you can look at is your home, and how sunlight interacts with it. Sunlight is often the major source of lighting (during the day) as well as a major contributor to the heat load of your house - which will determine your heater/fan/air conditioner usage, and by some simple modifications such as a makeshift chajja over your window, you may find that you can make your house more comfortable to live in! Another thing would be to look at your energy consumption habits and see how it affects the amount of energy consumed. As an example, you can analyze how you're driving your car and see if by slightly changing you driving pattern, how you can reach the destination in minimum fuel! So, once you start to look around and ponder, you'll see numerous applications, where you can see and apply whatever you learn in energy engineering and try to improve your own life!

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Pritesh Mittal, Dual Degree, 2014</h2>
                I clearly remember the days when I was in the dilemma of choosing IIT and branch. Actually they go hand in hand. It’s always a combination of IIT and Branch you get to choose from. Fortunately, for me it was simpler. I spoke to lot of people – seniors and alumni and was sure that I want to join IIT Bombay, no matter what! I guess, the sheer explore and the kind of people you meet at IIT Bombay outweighs everything else – at least for me it did!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Choosing a department is a very personal choice. It comes via gut feeling, perceptions and the rank (choices) you hold. Energy department started just one year prior I joined. During counselling, I spoke to my seniors about the course curriculum and the future options it would provide to me. Let me break everything down for you:
                      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
                        <li>Course Curriculum: The department offers a mixed curriculum of Chemical, Mechanical and a few courses of Electrical. You also get the freedom to choose courses from other departments as per your interests. Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed the course curriculum.</li>
                        <li>Future opportunities: For any branch in IIT Bombay, the future options depend on your overall performance throughout 4/5 years you spend here. Except Computer Science and Electrical, it is hardly dependent on the branch. So, don’t even worry about this. Energy as a department provides you interesting post graduate and PHD opportunities.</li>
                        <li>Academic Load: Average!</li>
                        <li>Faculty: Extremely supportive. I still remember reaching out to the faculties for anything to everything. In Hindsight, I feel that it was very stupid of me to reach out to faculties for everything but they always motivated me. I was always interested in starting up on my own. They always encouraged me to attend various events in and around Mumbai. Got me several connections. As a result of this support, I today have a startup NearFox. J</li>
                        <li>Electronic Systems</li>
                        <li>Extracurricular: Since the academic load is average, you will get sufficient amount of time to explore your interests.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br/>
                  Overall, Energy is a good department to opt for! Still as I mentioned in the beginning, choosing a department and IIT is a very personal choice. You should talk to lot of people before making a final decision.
                  <br/><br/>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">DAMP</h2>
            Departmental Academic Mentorship Program is an attempt by SMP to provide a helping hand available to students who aren't freshmen any more, with their academics.The program consists of highly motivated senior students from each department to act as mentors for a set of junior students and help them cope with any academic problems they may face in the department or otherwise.
            <br/><br/>
            Freshman year has common courses for all departments, except a Department Introductory Course. As in the future years, there are more of department specific courses and electives, and students may need assistance maneuvering their way through these. With this in mind, all sophomore are provided with a DAMP mentor. Mentors are also provided for any students with backlogs after sophomore year. The mentoring relationship provides an opportunity for development, both for the mentors and the students (mentee), thus being mutually beneficial.
            <br/><br/>
            SMP is a close knit team with the SMPCs at the top with a cabinet of six people to work with the different verticals under the SMP. Two Cabinet Head members lead a group of DAMP Coordinators (DAMPCs). Each department has one or two DAMPCs. The DAMPCs head a group of mentors who then come in contact with the students who need them (mentees). It is a purely voluntary program meant to pass on the experience, advice and techniques of managing academics through the generations.
            <br/><br/>
            DAMP attempts to make the academic life of all students in the institute easier, and makes sure those who require support never lack in it whatever year of your programme you might be in.

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
            Engineering Physics is an amalgam of physics, mathematics and electrical engineering courses. The program at IIT Bombay emphasizes on making students familiar with basic knowledge of physics along with a good background in engineering disciplines. It is closer to the basic sciences than most of the other engineering departments.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Engineering Physics all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">           
          The curriculum has a number of courses which introduce you to a wide variety of fields in pure Physics as well as applied Physics. The core courses cover basic areas such as classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, photonics, relativity, and thermodynamics along with introductory courses to the various fields. If you are disposed to move towards mathematics, you have the opportunity to do so, as we are the engineering branch with the most core math courses for UG’s. We do 4 electronics labs and some electrical engineering courses, so if your interests are inclined towards electronics or electrical engineering in general, you could take a minor in Electrical Engineering. Since this program equips you with several tools of mathematics and statistics, finance has become a lucrative option that is known to be open to our students. The take home message therefore is, that after completing your degree at IIT-B you are armed with the knowledge to choose whatever you wish to do in future.
            <br/><br/>
          Coming to the actual courses, besides compulsory courses students are also required to take up electives, which provide a student with the liberty to choose courses of their own choice, subject to a few guidelines. These electives further allow a student to explore their area of interest with more specialised courses on solid state physics, quantum computing and general theory of relativity, to name a few. Laboratory courses cover the basic techniques used in all the fields coupled with a knowledge in electronics which is an essential asset to every experimentalist. The department has necessary state-of-the-art labs. The professors are enthusiastic and approachable and one can go to them for first hand experience in real-life research. The nearby Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre organize regular seminars and colloquia on different fields of contemporary research, and also provide opportunities for students to work on research projects. Engineering Physics, being a (relatively) small department is a rather close-knit community, and seniors are known to be very friendly and helpful. In that spirit, we have regular department events and semester department trips.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">B.Tech + M.Tech Dual Degree with specialization in Nanoscience, and Integrated MSc in Physics</h2>
          In their 3rd year, EP B. Tech students have the option of switching to the Dual Degree program. The Dual Degree students at IIT-B, in addition to courses with B. Tech students for the broad fields mentioned above, do a specific set of courses related to nanoscience. The courses encompass the basic physics behind the phenomena at nanoscale and specific studies of materials like Graphene and Carbon-nanotubes, their synthesis and the nanofabrication processes. In addition, there are lab courses aimed at giving students hands-on experience on nanoscale techniques like Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) etc. In their final year, all students do a year-long intensive project related to the field of nanoscience, as part of their curriculum.
          <br/><br/>
          EP B. Tech students are also given an option of converting to integrated MSc (total 5 years) in physics, with the aim of allowing motivated students to specialize in fields other than nanotechnology (e.g. HEP, CMP, etc.).Recently, this option has been formalised with a prescribed set of additional courses to be completed for earning the integrated MSc degree. These include 6 additional courses and a year-long MSc project in a field of the student’s choice.          
          
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>    
          The major fields covered in the Engineering Physics programme at IITB are as follows:

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">High Energy Physics</h2>
          High Energy Physics (HEP) is the study of some of the most basic questions about the existence of our universe: the nature of the elementary constituents of matter and energy, and the interactions between them. We have courses related to both theoretical and experimental aspects of HEP. Theory in HEP involves concepts in nuclear and particle physics with applications of Quantum Mechanics. The experimental part of HEP involves designing and building experiments to detect and identify particles through particle detectors and accelerators. Analysis of data from particle physics experiments also forms a large part of Experimental HEP. The discovery of the Higgs Boson by the LHC at CERN is a perfect example of a combination of theory and experiment in HEP. Many of the professors at IIT-B are collaborators at places like CERN and Fermilab and are involved in some of the world’s largest and most famous experiments.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Condensed Matter Physics</h2>
          Matter exists in many fascinating forms. Metals, insulators, semiconductors, ferromagnets to name a few common ones and superconductors, topological insulators to name a few exotic ones. Condensed matter physics (CMP) is the study of various such forms of matter. The department runs various courses on introductory condensed matter physics, statistical physics and quantum mechanics to introduce students to the field. Experimental condensed matter physics deals with experiments on matter to look for new behaviour and then to explain it. Condensed matter physics is also used extensively in the electronic device industry.
          <br/><br/>
          At IIT-B, we have strong ongoing research in both theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics. Our department has several well equipped labs for experimental CMP. For those interested in the physics aspect of the semiconductor and electronic industry, we work on electron transport in novel materials (Graphene, thin films), from quantum dots, wires and wells to electron spin dynamics in solid state systems like defects in diamond and Silicon. We have the Center for Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CEN) as a central facility at IIT-B, which is one of the best nanofabrication facilities in India.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Biophysics and Non Linear Dynamics</h2>
          Soft condensed matter physics has a large overlap with the exciting new field of biophysics, with the goal being to understand universal behaviour shared by all similar systems, using techniques drawn from the physical disciplines of statistical and continuum mechanics. This includes the study of membranes, polymers and various other complex biological systems. Some professors also work collaboratively with the Biosciences and Bioengineering department of the institute.
            <br/> <br/>
          Non-linear dynamics studies the time evolution of more complex systems where we go beyond the basic first order term. It is used to model non linear dependencies, and these can give surprisingly chaotic or counterintuitive results. It has applications not just in biological physics but also in research areas as diverse as turbulence, population dynamics and finance.


          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Optics and Photonics</h2>
          Optics, as the name suggests, deals with study of light. It answers the questions about nature and behaviour of light in various environments and mediums. Photonics is a relatively recent branch of optics which came into being after Laser was invented. In photonics we deal with optical phenomena occurring due to interaction of light with various forms of matter. This leads to many interesting and beautiful phenomena and a great range of applications like fiber-optics, optoelectronics, optical switching etc. It also deals with metamaterials which can lead to revolutionary applications like an invisibility cloak! At IIT-B we have dedicated labs with advanced lasers for experiments in photonics, with intense research being done in theoretical and experimental aspects of both optics and photonics.


          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Quantum Information and Computing</h2>
          The field of quantum information and computing is all about leveraging the quantum nature of the world for efficient computation. Moving away from classical Boolean logic which runs the computing industry today, quantum computing introduces quantum analogs, qubit and quantum gates in its essence. Theoretical proposals for quantum algorithms which can be exponentially faster that their classical counterparts for certain problems such as integer factorization have brought this field to prominence in the last 30 years. At IIT-B, theoretical research is directed towards quantum thermodynamics and understanding the interplay between entanglement and heat of nanoscale devices such as qubits. On the experimental side, research is on building qubits in semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravity</h2>
          Astrophysics in itself is a vast field, dealing with the physics and evolution of extraterrestrial objects, ranging from planets and asteroids in our solar system to stars and planetary systems in galaxies light years away. Data from various ground and space based telescopes enables us to make surprisingly accurate predictions about these objects. Cosmology is a field combining the mystery of astrophysics and the rigour of mathematics to investigate the evolution of the universe to its current state, comprising of visible matter, light, dark matter and dark energy. Gravitational waves is a new and extremely useful probe into unveiling the mysteries of our universe. At IIT-B, research in astrophysics is focussed on time domain astronomy : identifying and understanding astronomical objects that brighten up for a short time, such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts. Cosmology research deals with the distribution and interactions of dark matter in the universe. Gravitational waves are also studied at IIT-B, which is home to a LIGO scientist.

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Future Prospects</h1>    
          As mentioned earlier, doors are very much open by the time you graduate from IITB.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Graduate School in Physics :</b> The significant number who have found a true passion for physics in the four/five years here, end up in some of the top graduate schools of the world, and go on to work as postdoctoral researchers and eventually respected professors in India and around the world.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Electrical Engineering Core:</b> For those interested in engineering, there’s also the option of working at companies which require a good knowledge of both physics and the engineering background given by our course experience with electrical devices like semiconductors, transistors, FPGAs etc.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Graduate School in Applied Physics :</b> One can also do a PhD in Applied Physics which would provide you with more technical knowledge.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Finance and Consulting :</b> In the past, after realizing physics might not be for them, some people have also taken up start-ups, finance and consulting jobs. We are also at an advantage for those jobs which can require math, since in addition to the math courses we do, there is a variety of applied math used in our core courses and electives.
          <br/><br/>  
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Final Word</h1>
        
        In conclusion, the Engineering Physics program at IIT Bombay is designed to give students the knowledge, technical expertise and interest to pursue a career in Physics or to take up Research & Development across various fields, and also the intelligence and dedication to do well in any other area, so make your choice wisely!

      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-5">Introduction</h1>
        <p className="mb-4"> 
            Our society’s influence on the natural world’s ecosystems and resources has never been more prominent or problematic than it is today. In order to better understand and address environmental challenges, environmental scientists and engineers provide technical solutions and advance innovations in environmental measurements, modeling, and control through the application of scientific and engineering principles.
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Environmental Sciences Progamme is all about?</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">           
          Dual degree in Environmental Science and Engineering is a programme with a goal of understanding, predicting and responding to human-induced environmental change. There is a need to address environmental issues such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, or local and regional air and water pollution requires perspectives from a diverse set of scientific disciplines including atmospheric physics and chemistry, oceanography, glaciology, hydrology, geophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry.
          <br/><br/>
        Environmentalists view the Earth system as a complex set of chemical, physical and biological interactions, made even more complicated by the various activities of human society. Through exploration of the underlying processes and feedbacks within the Earth system, and with a range of approaches from theory and modeling to experiments and observations.
        <br/><br/>
        This dual degree programme in Environmental Technology and Management has become essential because every industry and municipal body is expected to have Health, Safety and Environment Section and dedicated personnel. The graduating students will have excellent job opportunities in regulatory agencies, banks and commercial establishments as well as developmental agencies and consultancy firms. Other direct and indirect benefits would also emerge out of this programme, like it would necessitate and provide a formal structure for interdisciplinary collaborative work in the form of common courses and project work including sharing of laboratory facilities across the Institute.
        <br/><br/>

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>
          In the first year of the programme, the courses would be common for all new entrants of IIT Bombay apart from one department introductory course (DIC). The DIC for ESE Dual Degree students would be on Water Quality Management.Undergraduate students will be trained to think about environmental processes in an integrated fashion, preparing them to manage the environmental challenges we face.
          <br/><br/>
          The curriculum includes basic science courses and incorporates elective courses from science, engineering and humanities disciplines.

          Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is a confluence of applied mathematics, computing, technology, and management that aims to solve real-world problems through appropriate decision models. The BTech in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is a combination of two core disciplines of Operations Research and Industrial Engineering.
          <br/>
        <b>Operations Research (OR)</b> as a field studies complex human-technical systems and formal structures therein. It involves mathematical and decision models, including a range of optimization, simulation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning approaches to model and analyze a variety of problems arising in the context of planning, scheduling, and control in various domains.
        <br/>
        <b>Industrial Engineering (IE)</b> is the engineering discipline that focuses on designing, analyzing, improving, and controlling industrial and service systems, typically to better their efficiency and effectiveness in a sustained & resilient manner. The tools and understanding from OR plays a crucial role in IE            
        </p>

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Program Structure</h1>
            The B.Tech IEOR curriculum is designed to give a strong & broad foundation to UG students and to develop transferable skills across domains. It will be a balance of applied mathematics, computing, and hands-on problem-solving.
            <br/>
            
            The detailed curriculum can be found <a className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" style={{ padding: '0' }} target="_blank" href="https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/acad/btech">here</a>.<br />
            <br/>
            The BTech program includes common core courses in basic sciences (mathematics/ physics/ chemistry/ biology), humanities & social sciences (economics, design thinking, HASMED), engineering & technology (computer programming, Makerspace). These courses are common to all UG students at IITBombay, typically done in the first and second year of the BTech.
            <br/><br/>
            The department’s core courses begin with the “Introduction to IE and OR” (IE101) course in the very first semester. IE101 will introduce students to relevant broad themes of IEOR, along with necessary problem solving & systems thinking skills. The other department cores include courses on probability & statistics, optimisation (linear & non-linear), data structures & algorithms, control systems, artificial intelligence/ machine learning, stochastic processes, simulation, risk & uncertainty, industrial systems, operations analysis, logistics & supply chain. Most of these department core courses are in the second year, with a few in the third year. The second-semester course on probability and statistics is being introduced at least a semester earlier than its counterpart in other departments since the concepts form a basis for many decision models.
            <br/><br/>
            The BTech in IEOR program includes 6 core labs to perfectly complement the courses. This includes four computational labs, on algorithms & programming, optimisation, data analytics & AI/ML, and simulation; and two hardware labs on industrial engineering and digital enterprise systems. The computational labs will teach modeling and analysis skills using various tools and techniques. The hardware labs will have a modern twist to them and are meant to teach how data is collected and the various tools around it. These include but are not limited to IoT tools. The labs also aim to impart AR/VR experience.
            <br/><br/>
            Students can further gain breadth or depth on subjects by appropriately choosing department electives, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) electives as per their interests. Students can also opt for Honors in IEOR by completing additional courses and a capstone project. Minor in other disciplines are also possible.

        <p className="mb-4"> 
          Do things like race cars and robots excite you? If yes, this branch may be the one for you. This branch will give you a grounding in concepts related to machines, manufacturing processes, automation, controls and at the same time, give you the base to specialize in multi-disciplinary applications like mechatronics and robotics.          
        </p>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What is Mechanical Engineering all about?</h1>
      Mechanical Engineering is the science of machines. It will help you learn how to design a machine by keeping in mind the performance requirements as well as safety regulations. The branch is an amalgamation of broadly the following verticals: Thermodynamics, mechanics, systems and control, and manufacturing. Mechanical engineering introduces and teaches you the science behind the working and building of any mechanical system, be it as simple as a pulley-mass system or as complex as a rocket propeller. It will also help you understand different processes that need to be employed to manufacture these machines on a large scale.
        <p className="mb-4">           
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">BTech in Mechanical Engineering</h2>
          The B. Tech. curriculum is designed to introduce a student to the entire breadth of the field of Mechanical Engineering with a huge diversity in the courses. While the mandatory core curriculum rarely goes into the depths of any particular field, the department offers numerous electives that the students can take up based on the sub-disciplines that interest them. The BTech programme at IIT Bombay is one of the most flexible among all IITs, with a very lean mandatory component - called the core curriculum, leaving you plenty of time to explore the various fields that interest you - Mechanical or otherwise. The final year is left free to explore those fields that most interest you. This is in the form of electives - in the department and otherwise.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Dual Degree in Mechanical Engineering</h2>
          A DD programme is a 5 year course unlike the BTech program. It consists of extra elective courses and the dual degree project which is a research project under the guidance of a professor utilising the concepts learnt in the first 4 years. The extra electives can be chosen from a large basket of courses pertaining to a specialisation (there are 3 specialisations which are given later on this page). The final year is devoted almost solely to the Dual Degree Project (DDP) that is aimed to give the students a flavour of graduate level research in an area of their interest. After his/her second year, a B.Tech. student can convert to a Dual Degree programme in either of the three specializations. A DD student can also change his specialization after the second year but cannot convert to the BTech programme.
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Honors in Mechanical Engineering</h2>
          A B. Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honours in Mechanical Engineering” when he/she has done a certain number of courses from the honours course list of the department over and above the normal credit requirement (24 extra credits of electives/projects is required). This coursework is typically done in the second, third and fourth years. The exact details of the program are clearly specified in the academic rulebook of the institute. The department has a fairly flexible honors program allowing the choice of a great number of courses for the honors requirement. Many undergraduate courses are offered as honors courses and every postgraduate course usually is. You will be informed in detail about the exact format of the same after your first year.
          

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What kind of courses do you have to do?</h1>    
          While the first year is basically involved in consolidating basic knowledge in calculus, physics, chemistry and biology (like every other department). The second year lays down the basic foundation in all the four major areas which are Fluid Mechanics & Aerodynamics, Systems & Controls, Structures and Propulsion. The third year involved deeper understanding of all the four areas. This is when you’re exposed to a lot of experimental and laboratory work, which gives you an exciting perspective into how these things fit into the real world applications of Aerospace. The fourth year gives your entire experience a closure by having an Aircraft Design exercise where you apply all the knowledge that you’ve gained through the four years of learning in the department to create a technologically-viable aerospace product of your own. The department is very well-suited for pursuing research in any of these fronts. Most people opt for a Supervised Learning Program and B.Tech Projects to get their hands dirty with core research in aerospace.

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What courses would you be required to take up?</h1>    
          The courses are more or less an extension of the topics covered at the higher secondary level. It includes thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics and dynamics, solid mechanics, strength of materials, kinematics, particle dynamics, manufacturing processes and practices, control systems and so on. There are lab courses supplementing most of the basic theory courses. The course structure, in whole, covers the application aspect as well as the research aspect of Mechanical Engineering in day to day life.
          <br/><br/>
          In the first year of study, all students have common basic science courses (Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology). From the second year, department core courses begin. A year is spent on the basic fundamentals of fields like Thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, solid mechanics (stress, strain etc.) and manufacturing processes. The third year builds on these basics through courses on Heat Transfer, Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines, etc. BTech students have to choose 6 department elective courses from a huge bucket list of courses. A compulsory humanities elective and Economics is also present in the core curriculum. There is only one core theory course and one core lab course in the fourth year in the BTech program and there is complete freedom for the students to take the electives they wish to according to their interests.
        </p>


        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">Core specializations</h1>
      The three academic and research themes of the department and the corresponding Dual Degree specialisations are:
        <p className="mb-4">           
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Design (CADA)</h2>
          Computer-aided design (CAD), as the name suggests, is the use of computer systems to assist in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. CAD has become an important element in modern industry to perfect design, optimize material utilization, minimize cost, reduce design cycle time and customize activities.
          <br/><br/>
          This dual degree programme will focus on the fundamental issues of CAD and automation and their applications. It will cover computer aided stress and mechanical modelling, graphics, finite element and dynamic element packages, automatic and computer controls, micro and nano electro-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS), microprocessors, robotics, etc.
          <br/><br/>
          Design engineering can be carved out into several sub-fields (only few of them are given here):
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Solid Mechanics :</b> It is the foundation of design engineering with concepts used in all other sub-fields. It deals with concepts of stress and strain applied to deformable bodies. Taught through various courses like Solid Mechanics, Strength of Materials, Stress Analysis and Advanced Solid Mechanics, it is supported by a lab wherein experiments on bending, torsion, hardness, etc. are performed.
          <br/>
          <b>Machine Design :</b> It deals with design of gears, clutches, brakes, couplings, welded joints and all sorts of components that make up a machine, taking into account various design considerations - material selection, allowable stresses and deflections, fatigue and factor of safety.
          <br/>
          <b>Mechatronics :</b> This multidisciplinary field that combines mechanics, electronics, controls and computer science is religiously practiced not only by the students of this department but by many others who are interested in automation, robotics and microcontrollers. With wide applications in automotive and manufacturing industry, medical sciences, etc. mechatronics is everywhere.
          <br/>
          <b>Finite Element Method </b>: It’s a numerical technique that sits at the heart of most of the computational techniques used in structural, fluid and heat transfer analysis. Dividing large domains into smaller elements helps find approximate solutions to many real-world problems that may not be easily possible through analytical methods.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Manufacturing (CIM)</h2>
          Manufacturing today is loosely used to include all factory functions including product design, development, etc. Related terms are Production Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Manufacturing Engineering finds applications in Precision Manufacturing, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), Automation and Reverse engineering, Quality assurance and control, etc. It involves planning, managing and control of the operations of a manufacturing plant with the aid of computers. There are several subsections under manufacturing engineering like computer graphics, computer numeric control, material removal processes, medical device development, laser machining, modeling of manufacturing processes, microstructural mechanics, inventory management, etc.
          <br/><br/>
          Computer graphics, CNC, Rapid Product development, etc. involve more of coding. Material removal processes and modelling of manufacturing processes deals with drilling, cutting, forming, etc. where you need to understand the physics of the problem. This requires you to have more of an analytical approach and generally involves less coding but more of simulation using softwares like ANSYS, COMSOL, ABACUS, etc. Inventory management and quality assurance are more management related topics and require knowledge of statistical techniques. We have research facilities and courses in another important area of research, which relates this branch with material science. With weight reduction having great demand almost everywhere in today’s world, research in manufacturing using lighter materials like composites is a hot topic these days.
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Thermal and Fluid Engineering (TFE)</h2>
          TFE is one of the foundational themes of ME and a core competency of the department. It finds applications in diverse systems such as air conditioners and refrigerators, fuel cells, IC engines, MRI and NMR machines, nuclear reactors, power plants, satellites and re-entry vehicles, steam and gas turbines, turbomachinery, and so on. It attempts to answer questions like:
          <br/><br/>
          How do cats lap up liquids like water or milk so elegantly? Why does a falling column of liquid, like the water from your tap, tend to break up into a series of droplets? How are Rafael Nadal and Michael Phelps empirical fluid mechanists without even knowing it? On a sunny day, why is it more comfortable to walk on soil than to walk on rocks? Both are at the same temperature and yet the rocks feel much hotter than the soil.
          <br/><br/>
          TFE requires an understanding of concepts in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Knowledge of calculus, differential equations and numerical analysis along with some computer programming is also needed. These form the foundation of all applied and advanced subjects in TFE. TFE overlaps with many fields of study, e.g. aerospace engineering, earth sciences, energy science and engineering, environmental engineering, and physics.
          <br/><br/>
          Current research in the department encompasses combustion, computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer, cryogenics, enhanced heat transfer, geophysical flows, high performance computing, microfluidics and nanofluidics, multiphase flows, nuclear engineering, numerical methods, reactor safety, refrigeration and air conditioning, shock physics, thermal hydraulics, and turbulence.

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-15 mb-5">What after you are a Mechanical Engineer?</h1>
        
        As is evident from the write-up, Mechanical Engineering as a discipline will always be present in the industry and the demand of Mechanical engineers working on collaborative projects with engineers of other fields will always be there. Depending on one’s interest, there are plenty of avenues. After graduation, there are students who go for MS and PHD in Mechanical Engineering to reputed universities throughout the globe (the likes of Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, etc.). Some take up jobs in core engineering companies (like General Electric, Schlumberger, Sony, Daikin, etc.). Some students also enter the field of entrepreneurship through their own startups (both core and non-core). Many others take up jobs in the non-core sector (consult, finance, analytics, IT, etc.) in top multinational companies (like Mckinsey, Goldman Sachs, American Express, Procter and Gamble, etc.) which come to the institute for placements. The remaining either pursue MBA (from top colleges like IIMs) or the UPSC Exams depending upon their interest.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Antariksh Bothale, Mechanical Engineering Dual Degree (2011)</h2>
        
            As someone who enjoys breadth of learning, I opted for Mechanical Engineering during JEE Counseling because I found it to be fairly broad-based among all the viable choices available to me, and the general course content felt interesting. As a dual degree student, I’ve spent a lot of time with the department, both due to an increased number of courses and because of the DDP (final year Dual Degree Project).
            <br/><br/>
            It might be almost a cliché among all the alumni accounts you'll read in this section, but I really did enjoy my academic life at IITB. There were plenty of good professors and interesting courses in the department, and I started liking even tiny things (such as quizzes late in the night) which had felt weird in the beginning :). Earlier, the department used to be more TFE (Thermal and Fluids Engg.) heavy, but that has changed in the last few years, so, you can expect to have larger variety of courses in the other sub-fields too. There's also plenty of active student-managed projects that you can be a part of if you find them interesting—from FSAE to BAJA to autonomous underwater vehicles, Robocon and the like. There's plenty to keep you occupied if you find Mechanical Engg. interesting and fun.
            <br/><br/>
            For most people, their undergrad years are some of the most formative parts of their life, and I am no different. There’s a lot that IITB teaches you—whether it be in lectures or outside. The other day, I was trying to solve JEE exam questions from this year’s paper (the one you aced). Although my JEE preparation days are, thankfully, 8-9 years in the past, I could solve most of the questions using first principles that only seem to have been strengthened during my time at IIT. I realized that, especially in Physics, I had a much deeper understanding of most of the topics because of my training as a Mechanical Engineer.
            <br/><br/>
            Most department at IITs have associated reputations. I don’t know what the current ‘fashion’ is, but I found Mech to be a good department to be in, and I didn’t find substance in the slight bit of fear-mongering I had initially been subjected to about how it was a difficult department to be in. While it’s true that I have since moved to a different field and industry (I did an MS in Computational Linguistics after working in Management Consulting for a year and now working in the software industry), I had a great time in the department during my IITB time.
            <br/><br/>
            Like most other things, how much IITB gives you depends on how much you are willing to take out of it. There is a lot that this place has to offer, and I hope that you will use all the resources here as best as you can.
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">Chinmay Deo, Mechanical Engineering Dual Degree, Minor in Electrical Engineering (2013)</h2>
            While deciding my branch I had spoken to a few people who had gone to IIT, and being from Bombay, I decided that I wanted to study in IIT-Bombay. That along with the fact that I really liked the Mechanics & Thermodynamics section from the JEE syllabus, and was told that Mechanical Engg would be closely related to it. Later on, the field turned out to be completely different from what I thought it would be, but in a good way. Good freedom in terms of choosing courses & electives, the opportunity to do research in your undergraduate years, approachable professors and some of the smartest classmates you can find!
            <br/><br/>
            At IIT Bombay, I was focussed on my academics, since for me that was one of the main reasons I had entered IIT and I enjoyed most of my courses. As a dual degree student, I had the opportunity to work on a year long research project as my masters thesis in the field of control systems[a mixture of mechanical & electrical engineering]. Some of the exciting areas in Mechanical Engineering are Product Design/Product Development, Micro & Nano engineering - studying the mechanical properties of micro/nano-level structures as products get smaller every year, Robotics(includes large doses of electrical engineering and computer science as well). In the Mechanical Department @ IITB, students can expect exposure to a wide variety of general engineering subjects, access to some top quality professors. Also - mechanical engineering courses are famous for their 9pm-10pm quizzes on a few nights every week :)
            <br/><br/>
            What you end up doing after IIT is largely a function of what you do in IIT. What you have done before entering IIT doesn't matter at all. At IIT-B, you can be assured of access to a huge variety of opportunities, both in terms of jobs(either at multinationals, large indian companies or startups), research(in labs, colleges, or external organizations), further degrees(MS/PhD/MBA) or even entering fields not related to science at all(public policy, government, non profits etc). I am currently working with Avanti - an enterprise that tries to get more low-income kids into top quality engineering/science colleges(such as IIT-B) through running our own programs across the country. We are currently working with over 1200 students across 12 locations. We are currently growing our organization multiple times over every year and the expansion process, and spreading education to students across interior India is what really excites me!
            <br/><br/>
            Apart from the fact that I have met my closest friends in IIT, I think I have learnt a few important things from my time here -

          Apart from the fact that I have met my closest friends in IIT, I think I have learnt a few important things from my time here -


            <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Always be humble - all of you will have this realization as soon as you enter IIT and meet people who are better than you in almost every field imaginable(both in and out of the classroom)</li>
            <li>Use the next 4/5 years to try as many new things as possible without fear of failure - you will never get this freedom again. Learn to fail at things - most people entering IIT have only experienced success for all of their life.</li>
            <li>Do not be blindly influenced by what other people say - There will always be people around you telling you to do certain things, or to do things in a certain way. Listen to their opinion, consider it, and then do what you feel is right</li>
            <li>Your opinion about most things will change, as will your likes/dislikes - you, your parents, and your friends should be prepared for it</li>
            <li>What you get from IIT is purely dependant on how much you involve yourself in things - be it academics or extra-curricular activities. If you love engineering, you can build racecars and travel the world. If you love drama you can do a play at the best theatres in the country. If you love singing, you can perform in front of a crowd of thousands. If you love research, you can work with the best universities & professors in the world. There is no ceiling!</li>
